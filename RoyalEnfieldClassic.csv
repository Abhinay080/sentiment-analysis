1,2,Maintenance cost is very high basically some parts are very weak they need to replace in every 10000km running like self bearing and chain sprocket handle racer. It required to service within running of 2500km. As you rise the speed more than 80 km the bike start vibrate and fuel consumption is about.
2,4,Royal enfield classic 350 is a affordable cruising bike with a great mileage of approximately 35 to 40 kmpl. Classic is a very well customization bike good for touring. With pillion removed this bike looks like a bobber which is quite stunning. cons is basically its maintenance should be quite often. Due to its vibration some nuts may loosen which needs to be checked and serviced time to time.
3,4,It's an amazing bike. Riding this bike is a absolute pleasure in the cities . I had few issues with the rear disc and the chain sprocket but after the first service all this issue were solve. One think that disappoints me in this 1.6 lakhs is that it doesn't gets a tubeless tyre and a fuel gauge .
4,4,I have to wait 1month to buy this bike.. Riding experience is good. A little pain in my boom while I rode it above 100kms continuously. It gives a retro look and I love it. Service cost is slightly higher. But I have not face any major issue. Its mileage is 30 to 35. Performance is good.. It can run 80km/h easily.. pros- looks is awesome engine is good. Good mileage though it is 350cc Cons-Vibration is the big issue.
5,4,"This bike is very good and gentle to ride, its full of comfort for long rides.The look of this bike is awesome. Simple design but very classy.It's nice to control. And it's power is also great, with a nice braking stability.But for my purpose it's ground clearance is a bit low though it has 135mm of ground clearance."
6,5,Royal enfield classic 350cc is one of the most comfortable bike. For touring and long journey it is very comfortable. Handling is also good. I love this bike. Maintenance cost is little high but if you ride an enfield then you feel its power and comfort. For off-roading and travelling it is most comfortable bike.
7,4,"The buying experience was great, hospitality of the showroom was very good. The power can be felt while riding.I like the looks of the bike when the rear seat is taken off. Every other things of this bike will never make you bored of. You will always love this bike. My servicing experience is awesome. I will definitely recommend you a classic 350."
8,4,"1.Give you a great mileage 2.Be an easy to repair bike if u find yourself stranded somewhere in the middle of a highway 3. Epitomise the idea of bike featuring excellent quality 4.The loud thunder, the ultra loud horn and the even louder looks, are bound to attract attention on road. And trust me, you will love it."
9,5,Riding experience..The only first in class with royal looks bike is royal enfield classic 350.. Wow its siting position is awesome and comfort doesn't matches with any bike.. All over the bike is build for the toughest Indian roadways...The best bike for long journeys as well as for city use.. Dual disc segment could have been changed to a single disc option..
10,4,"I bought the bike back in 2015 and rode around 40k kms till date, the riding experience is excellent for long drive, but this bike is definitely not for city ride. The mileage is quite good for the relaxation that felt during riding.Taking all round experience, the bike is really comfortable for long ride."
11,5,"Royal enfield looks very royal and it gives a very dashing and a glorious look ,when anyone ride it the enfield and the person seems to be king and enfield seems to be the horse.I recommend all our Indian brothers to buy a enfield but not below 18. Moreover enfield is very safe due to its side guards ,i have experience .Its too good."
12,5,Maintenance cost is very high basically some parts are very weak they need to replace in every 10000km running like self bearing and chain sprocket handle racer. It required to service within running of 2500km. As you rise the speed more than 80 km the bike start vibrat...
13,5,"The bike may be costly but its performance is high.. Feels very relaxing while riding it.. So comfortable.. But the mileage is low that is the only disadvantage.. Otherwise it is a perfect bike..It has got a thrilling sound, it is so fascinating.. Wonderful bike..Feels like as if i am riding a monster bike.."
14,5,"I own this bike from past 2 years . The maintenance cost is average and it has excellent riding comfort. I have not found any issue from the time when i bought this bike. I am shocked that people say that its not good bike cannot go fast .. I know it vibrates at 80 kmph but this bike is not like others .... Its not just a bike ..It is more then a bike... I saw that people compare this bike with ktm or other bikes having 300 cc engine and above , this bike is not like those bikes ... Its a retro , not a racing bike. All owners think that my bike is perfect than others... I am not saying its a good bike because i own this bike.. I am astonished that people say that .... Ye tezz nahi chalta hai .... And many more this bike is not made to drive fast ..... It was made to provide better riding comfort for long rides ....People think that its a 350cc bike and it cannot win race with even 200cc bike .... It is not made for racing guys .."
15,5,Its a great bike. Delivers the feel of a gun. Its a heavy duty and a legendary bike. Comfortable for the rider and the pillion. It got a most sophisticated riding position. The bike is easy to handle while riding and the suspension is great. The maintenance is great and the service center are very helpful.
16,4,"Being a cruiser bike fan i didn't have much option to buy other bikes than royal enfield, the service manager was helpful while buying, buying experience was very well and excited for royal enfield  Riding experience is good as no other bikes can give the feeling that royal enfield gives, very comfortable to ride on any condition of toad  The looks of royal enfield is heart stealing, and the performance of bike is damn good,  Servicing the bike for first time for me was good, but after the first service the mileage of bike is improved, the maintenance of bike depends on the rider, how he keeps his bike clean and safe  Pros - Beautiful looks, Loud horn, Silencer sounds is unique among all other bikes, Comfortable seat, Hugh powered engine, Whole body metal  Cons - Very high weight, Vibration start on reaching 80kmpl above, No fuel meter, No tubeless tyres, No alloy wheels"
17,5,"I love royal enfield. My most favourite bike is royal.I also have a gun metal gray. When i riding on my bike feel like god.This is my dream bike.And i love the royal enfield showroom.And there service. All employees are very nice and good.When training in this bike,you feel a great moment.I love this."
18,4,"1. Buying experience is good and showrooms are very neatly decorated. 2. At seeing the bike you'll feel like you can't ride this , it weighs 192kgs, it will be difficult to maneuver. But the reality check is it's super easy to ride, handlebars feel light when you ride it and pickup is also very punchy and it feels light on his feet. 3. It's having a timeless design and a charm which attracts people and while it uses a very similar type old-school twin spark carburettor single cylinder engine there is abundant of torque on offer and power for daily commutes and occasional highway rides. 4. Service experience is not that good because when you tell them some issue is there in the bike then sometimes they say you that it is a factory fault and we can't do anything. Pros : 1. Timeless design and nicely themed showrooms. 2. Good for daily commutes due to abundant presence of torque. 3. Very light and easy to maneuver. It's just a matter of time for getting used to it. Only in standstill you'll feel the weight. 4."
19,5,"The bike is very good.The riding quality is so comfortable for long riding.And also the mileage is so beautiful,and the power is so good.And the service experiences are awesome.Royal enfield is a trusted company and bikes r so good."
20,4,I use enfilade 350 classic. It's a amazing looking bike and strong than others. It gives 35 km mileage . When i ride it on 110 km / h it's not vibrate but other bikes vibrates . It's a good bike for long tour . I think 350 is good than 500 cc because 350 gives better mileage .All enfilade user feel proud because they use enfield. I am so proud . It's not a bike it's a tiger
21,5,Buying experience is best . My dream bike.To royal.It fell like royal. It has low maintenance.It's is super good bike.It's good experience. It's servicing cost is low.It's is very strong bike. Bike has good looking tyre. Alloy wheels....Headlight.... Front disc brake and back disc brake are too smooth.
22,5,One of the best bike i have ever bought riding it from past 2 year and don't have much problem i just do regular service at 3000 kms and fill fuel nothing else no problem or any huge maintenance cost just buy it no problem but only if you can take care of this beast and i easily gets mileage of 35-40 in city which is good enough.
23,5,I was founding some powerful bike under 350 cc segment then i found royal enfield 350 classic which has bold look and whole metal design. Riding experience is like royal people. Bold look feels heavy and good performance as 350 cc bike segment. Less maintenance or maintenance free bike. Service quality of this bike is good Pros.. Easy to control on road. Cons.. Heavy.
24,4,"I'm have been using classic 350 since june 2015. It's a great bike. I'm getting around 40 kmpl mileage, which is brilliant i think. The only issue i'm having is the rusting of the various areas. I think every biker have a dream of owning a royal enfield and every biker should once ride a royal enfield."
25,5,It is very comfortable ...You can use it for long journey but don't think it is sporty But it will give you more comfort. I have bought it 2 yr before everything is ok only sometimes i feel top seed should be increased.At the service center there are trained staff you will not face any problem Maintenance of bike is little bit high but not as much so that you cant afford.
26,5,I owned classic 350 from 2016 and i feel blessed that these types of bike i have. It's controlling is excellent and most importantly when i ride it for long tour it's helpful in jerking it's shocker is superficial.I can't explain in words that this bike give comfort to me.Looks are not well but good .I am happy on owning this bike.Thanks for giving me opportunity to talk about my rowdy my classic.
27,5,"New re classic 350 riding quality is amazing and abs is working great while riding, i always think its have clear fuel gauge meter. Current fuel gauge can not identify that's how much fuel in tank. For average height rider have high low seating position adjustment in bike. And by the way classic is amazing riding quality. I am talking about new classic 350."
28,5,"Hi friends, my one friend has this bike i once drove this bike i felt so happy and i was just feeling very happy and confused that it was a bike or a cloud It was just gorgeous and i felt that i cannot control my self a some tears also came I was a royal enfield user before 20 years but these years i was riding different bikes And re has refined its engine also."
29,5,"Royal enfield is the best bike for me and also lucky because this bike give me a service in a big company so i think it's lucky for me, and also my friend buy a royal enfield thunderbird it's good but my its better than friend. I am looking a macho look with my royal enfield classic 350 best colour with green so i am happy with my great bike."
30,4,Royal enfield is always the first and best choice among the youth..I have a fantasy of this bike since my childhood.. Bullet is something which feels as power and pride.My father had gifted me classic 350.As a equal right of both of us..Riding bullet is always a dream for me..As in reality it is far much better..The sound the seat is something which is very difficult from all other bikes available in market in this range.I bought it in colour of red and black..Which i think is best suited on me and my bullet.. It has a best mileage of 45 kmpl..Its looks is very attractive and in red it is on its peaks..Very bright head lamp and comfortable seats very nice ground clearance and large spoke wheels..Gives you the best riding experience of all time... It's service and parts are not costly at all..Very nice and friendly tech and support team is always available for you bullet ..And the service centre is also very co operative and value your time and money.This is not all . There is far much more thing which royal
31,5,"I bought this bike from kolkata just before the lockdown for my daily office journey. It's classic 350. Red in colour. It's giving really a royal feeling. Red and black combination is my favorite also. I bought this bike for it's killer look and royal feeling with a good performance. I modified my dream bike with extra 40k. Then, it's become more killer at its look."
32,4,If you are looking for modern features then enfield is not for you. You will not get a digital instrument cluster neither usd fork not even a slipper clutch. Enfield is clearly a emotion a status but the build quality is extremely good. You can't go for a race but you can go for a long tour. So think wisely. If you are looking for a high performance bike don't go with this but if you are looking for a comfortable and royal ride go for enfield. I hope this will help.
33,1,I'm very excited to buy royal enfield main road a few months later the service quality is very poor and their exist very vibration when i go to service center they cannot solve my problem and the mileage is very bad no power to 350cc actually this is very bad bike also and the maintenance charge is affinity cosplay and the performance is not very good. Breaking is very bad light illumination is not good a night you do not see the road in night anti braking feed rate is very very very bad yamaha bike is very very very good company find a hero honda i suggest to not speak to the royal enfield classic 350 or thunderbird 350 you can go to buy yamaha fz25 bs6 fzs25 bs6.
34,4,"buying experience is very good,riding experience is too good,looks is awesome,performance is very good,but millage is bad,service is good,if you re buying a royal enfield you have to maintain it, pros: 1. looks 2. performance 3.durability 4.comfort cons: 1. mileage 2. maintenance in 1 word you are buying a most loved machine,so you have to take care of it."
35,4,"If i talk about pros then those are endless but cons are little so cons are: since this bike has been attracting both young and elderly peeps so 1st for young peeps: you won't feel the punch in acceleration like your life's having right now, its a butter smooth motorcycle 2nd for the elderly men: might give you spondylosis coz of the vibration bit it can be eliminated if you get an aftermarket handle bar. 3rd Its for both as it still lacks many digital mechanism but at the same point if you think of the name i.e Classic then i hope it won't matter.. by design it maybe classic but in riding it will give you a modern feel."
36,5,"Bought this towards january end in 2020. Showrooms were running out of stock when i heard from one that bs-iv was still available with them. Was not interested in bs-vi because the price differential seemed unjustified at that time and still does. Wanted to buy re for a few reasons - i) father's dream to own an re since childhood ii) retro styling and riding comfort was like none other iii) road safety due to the weight being on the heavier side(yes it is quite heavy for a first rider to manage a ~200 kg bike). Went to the showroom to get a bullet electra but found out that they still had a bs-iv classic left. Considering the fat back tire and better seats, it was a no-brainer that classic was to be the obvious choice.Read a lot of reviews before buying, found both positive and negatives, occasionally dropped the idea of buying this bike(based on reviews) as getting this monster was not a necessity but a luxury. It was not a practical purchase as our commutes are usually taken care of through cars. Yes, the"
37,5,"It was very good bike in classic style. riding experience is good and keen to killer looks. low maintenance cost. Disappointed by its vibration, when you ride the bike on 120 kmph. its not racing bike, it is a classic bike that you ride upto 40-70. in city mileage is 33 and on highway mileage is 38. mileage totally depend on your riding style. Overall its good bike for daily use."
38,5,"Superb bike i like it to much my dream.Now m going to purchase this from kolkata .Superb puck up , easy to handle , easy to drive also . So' please guy's purchase this bike and feel like king on the road .Maintenance is little bit high but we can handle it to take this type of enjoyment."
39,5,"classic is one of the best looking motorcycle in India. performance is ok of its riding, you can never expect agility of a naked sports bike and a pickup of a fairing bike (sports bike).... If u r looking for a bike which you want to ride it on weekends rides and go for a long drive then its is the Best bike for u..."
40,5,"1.You have to book it before 1 week 2.Riding experience is awesome.Feel like king.But after 65km speed vibration appears.3.Average 32-35 km, performance is really amazing, little bit heavy.4.Service cost is medium approx 1500-2000.5. Pros: comfortable, easy to maintain,new model has minimum sound.Cons: vibration, mirror vibrates, back kick is so much powerful."
41,4,"I bought it this year and really loving it, if u are thinking for a bike for town ride then this may be your bike.Till now i have traveled 700 km in this bike and really it's awesome.Pros :1.It is comfortable, 2.It gives u a royal look, 3.The sound gives u a sense of power that the engine releases ,4.Color options are available, 4.Full metal, 5.Shiny look (if maintained properly), 6.Mileage is also good. Cons:1.Too much weight, 2.Price is little bit higher than standard version of this, 3.Rusting( if not maintained properly), 4.No digital meter, 5.No fuel gauge, 6.Vibration."
42,5,Classic 350 is an awesome bike and also good for city.. Its feel is premium like you ride a lion.. Performance is good and looks are like king of all bikes.. Servicing and maintenance are not much easy as it is very expensive but still they are expensive but will get assured quality work.. pros :1. Suitable for city ride and hilly areas 2.Comfortable seats 3.Great quality materials used cons:1.Back break always loosens very quickly 2.Needs maintenance quickly before time 3.A bit heavy.
43,5,"1- royal enfield salesman behavior is very friendly.2- and this bike riding is feel light and very confident. 3- this bike look present very massive and macho, road presentation look very good and different in crowd, this bike performance is not very well but i am happy with that performance due to that is do not made of drag race or speed, this is made for cruising, 4- servicing and maintenance is not going so high and not a low it's affordable or nominal,royal enfield is a passionate bike for me . That's why i will happily afford that nominal maintenance and servicing charge due to maintain.5- this pros and con is like instrument console limited wheels tyre,battery not maintenance free it's can be better good thing is : body balance and fully mattel body, alight look trusted brand and trusted engine durability body parts essly availability."
44,5,"Pros:1)when it is on above 80km/hr then your are a king on road.2) the minimum noise of original silencer.3) this is a heavy bike,so much stable.4) comfortable seat.5)enjoy long journey with this bike.Cons:1)no fuel meter. 2)mirror vibrates bellow speed 45.3)engine heats in less time.My king is my royal enfield."
45,5,"Riding experience is too good. I have completed 600 kilometres within 2 days and the mileage was too good that was unexpected for me. Really classic 350 overall a good looking bike of bike industry because it is a vintage look bike and also i like that look. If i am talking about suspensions, that really very good performed on off-road and on-road. Also carrying capacity, balance, noise everything can under your expectation."
46,1,"I had a classic 350cc royal enfield which i already sold, very low pickup, can buy a r15 instead of wasting money on royal enfield. It looks like a 1970's bike. Looks like a duffer. No modern sports design, stupid oil tank just look like a fat person tummy. Engine sounds is too stupid, the sleeping dogs starts barking .. Fat body design just like a hyphopotenous. A guy passing behind you with a pulsar 220 or any other commuter or sports bike looks more smart. The pillion position seat same looking like a auto rickshaw front seat. Better royal should manufactured auto rickshaw rather than motorcycle. It suits it's company status like a auto rickshaw manufacturers. The fuck 350 cc engine is so slow that any one can overtake it with a 180cc pulsar or apache rtr. Every time when i sit at pillion seat of the bike, i feel i am sitting in front seat of rickshaw. Guys don't waste your money by purchasing royal enfield, it's not 1970's. Now 2018."
47,5,Awesome bike for Indian conditions. Look no further if you are into buying a classic looking bike in the 350 segment... Great bike.....Looks are gorgeous. The ride quality is majestic for this price point on Indian territory.Take you back into a era and gives you a wonderful feeling of royalty that used to be of old.
48,4,Buying experience was not that good enough because in silchar classic 350 is in high demand so you have to wait (q) .While riding i feel like i am the one an only boss on the road.Looks that i don't need to say everybody knows that very well. (awesome) while i ride the bike near market area everybody stare at me and my bike.Performance is at its best One an only cons is fuel efficiency. But due to 350cc engine you can't see that as a cons.
49,5,"It's get to feel us like i am the royal and a king, a very good experience to ride it, it is the most amazing and good looking bike i had ever bought, it's performance is so good, mileage is also awesome, the servicing of the bike is very good and the maintenance cost is also not so high that anyone can't afford."
50,5,First of all this bike is very useful for me as i am using it as daily commuter bike and i am riding it since eight months. This bike has powerful and fuel efficient engine as i am talking about bsiv model as i have gun grey classic 350cc. And its very good ride in hill and terrain area like sikkim north east India..Very good fr go long ride. Its giving me 32km mileage right now which is satisfied for me.I had booked this bike on 25th of Nov 2017 and re showroom siliguri 2nd mile sevoke road delivered this bike after 42 days of booking i.E on 4th Jan 2018 it was new gift for new year. I had done 1st service at same showroom and service was good and riding is smooth till now no problem...Guys who really wants to feel like riding a bike which have powerful engine thump and comfortable seating posture straightly go for it. No matter whoever call it haathi(elephant) cause it has extra identity and respect.
51,5,“royal enfield” The legend of motorcycles Buying experience-wonderful Riding experience-when i ride my re i feel i am the king..Looks-a machine..And re classic 350 is looks like a young man in re generations.Performance- a1 Servicing-depends upon on your riding style..But it comfortable to maintain I love classic 350 more than anything else..My first and last love classic 350.
52,5,"Buying RE is always the best experience. As it is a cruise bike not a racing, so don't race with it else you will not be able to enjoy the cruise riding. It is the best when you are at about 50-60 kmph. Looks are totally different when you remove the pillion saddle, as I did in my Classic...try it for watching more people at your RE Classic...."
53,4,"The buying experience was great, i bought it with emi option for a tenure of 36 months.The bike ride is great for both daily commute and off roading. The looks of bike is much better than its electra model but i wish it had the same tank as of re bullet standard which has 3d engraving and painted with hands.Maintenance cost is somewhat higher than other bikes but it deserves that attention and care.The only con is the gearbox, sometimes gears box confuses me, leaving that the whole bike is great and worthy of riding."
54,5,"1.You have to book it before 1 week 2.Riding experience is awesome.Feel like king.But after 65km speed vibration appears.3.Average 32-35 km, performance is really amazing, little bit heavy.4.Service cost is medium approx 1500-2000.5. Pros: comfortable, easy to maintain,new model has minimum sound.Cons: vibration, mirror vibrates, back kick is so much powerful."
55,2,"I bought my bike 6 months ago. I felt i am proud owner of classic 350 redditch model. Few days back my bike broken down near my shop. Then i called rsa(road side assistance) which royal enfield claims a 24x7 service. They asked me to put my bike in some safe place as they cannot provide service. I felt bad and that was obvious. Because when u buy a bike for rs 1.80 lakh, you would expect much better service, showroom owner said i don't have mechanics right now so i would send it tomorrow. But today again i face the same problem and the showroom owner gave me the same excuse. It is so heartbreaking. I like travelling places on my bike. Now after such poor service. I am scared. What if my breakdown in the middle of a forest or unknown place. What if i get same reply that time. Please think before buying. besides service bike is awesome. Feel proud. But service will let you down,Major cons.1. Service.2. Poor wiring. (because right now i come to know that there was cut in wire, and the wire was totally covered."
56,3,"Guys if you are looking for buying re then you should think twice as its service is high,it irritates lot after 1 year bike demands more service its suspensions are not good and bike is low so some time brake touches its my personal opinion but riding it gives good feeling that tic tic sound and vibration irritates very much"
57,3,bike is good but parts are very expensive. too much vibration as like tractor no much comfort. top speed is not satisfied 110-120kmph. pillion comfort is nil. worst for pillion. pick up is good service quality is good but somewhere is bad. light is good. rear brakes are not satisfied. royal Enfield should provide led lamp for good battery life because of AHO. rear suspension is not good so RE provide mono shock suspension.
58,3,It was good but it takes more fuel and it has good sound and comfortable riding and really attract others by its sound and great bold look it had but it has only did advantage of oil leaking and drinking more fuel and it was one of the good bike which i ride on road it was really awesome but it has to be improved some features.
59,4,"1. Buying experience - it was pretty usual though i was overexcited about it. 2. Riding experience - man now we're talking cause this bike feels so good and that thump acts like the cherry above the cake. Though at higher rpms there is vibration but keep room low and it is butter smooth.3. Looks - i believe looks are subjective thing if you like retro looking motorcycle then go for it and yeah it has got a lot of chrome too.4. Servicing and maintenance - yeah the service and maintenance cost is high and the fuel economy is low too as its a 350cc beast but it's manageable.5. Pros - comfort, suitable for long rides, design, room for modifications, power. cons - viby, lack of info in the console, expensive parts."
60,1,This worst bike ever..What is riding experience means.  Full burnout engine...Oil dripping never be solved...Handle curve worst in segment..You can't do work fast with this bike...In case of emergency it's dumbest bike...And after purchase you have to carry burden of service centre...Cause they are making fool everybody and their aim only to making money...Not satisfied customer..
61,5,"I purchased my re redditch red 350 last year,after reading reviews on bikewale.Com which helps alot to select this model from re. As the name of machine itself described as royal. My first long tour planned within one month of purchase for leh-ladhak (dream ride for most of bike lovers). I enjoyed the ride during this tour bcoz this royal machine do not bother about the distance,road, altitude, it is just smooth. Look is sexy of redditch red, which are verified in ladhakh trip photo's.Most of cities have authorized service center, not too much high in maintenance as rumors always in the air for re. First service done in leh city of my machine during ladhakh trip.For royal bike lover, there is no cons, all are pros like riding experience, smooth ride,power,royal look,you can as much experiments as you want in this machine for modification. And when you go in group for touring on re, all the eyes on you with a sigh !"
62,4,"Bike is awesome, it's look is so much fabulous Bike's sound is so good and one of the main attractive thing is it's tyres which is broad than the standard version of old bullet and its alloy wheels are also so attractive so that u don't need to change them from outside because company already given you in this mode. Overall it's awesome with better average."
63,5,"I am very glad and felt happy once I bought royal enfield classic 350. I was trained in college bike race and long drive habit with my friends. After i grown up become it industry, I couldn't participate or drive any bikes past 10 years. Because I was so lazy drive in car to take all the places and I lost passion. After I bought this bike, I feel very happy and recover all my passion, spirits in my life. Riding and performance really awesome while driving long distance. I am heavy wait personality and never tired to handle this bike. The maintenance is very low with compare to other bikes or scooter which my family have that. My best advice whoever they are missed manly or braveness in the middle age, they should choose classic and it will give more joyfulness and wondering in the world. Cons :Head light power is need to improve if you drive in rural area."
64,3,I have been using this for 2 months the new abs model and the riding feel could have been good but due to the vibration i can't drive it for more than 100km in a single ride... Due to high vibration u can't even see anything in mirror... Braking is good... Mileage is bad as i am getting only 25kmpl in city and 27kmpl in highway.... Not happy with the bike...
65,5,"Style Looks good but to be improved Engine performance, fuel economy and gear box Excellent, it's a 350cc bike, but it will easily give you more than 45km/lt Ride quality & handling No question.....Final words If you love your life than go for it... Because it is not a plastic bike like other manufacturers. |its a steel bike. It will give you more safe drive.Areas of improvement Waiting period Pros Indian bike wining world Cons Look."
66,1,Had purchased bike in August 2017  Driven 3500 km  Did 3 service  Faced clutch setting problem since purchased  Jerking  Vibrating  Brake pad has short life of 2500km  Air filter has short life  Tappet noise make louder  Chain spray after every wash n we have to pay 300 rs for it  Must to change oil at every 2000 km  So maintenance is very high
67,3,"My dad bought it with so much love for this machine. It definitely feels great to own an re. Road seems less trouble for the rider* with the suspension and control that one enjoys even at high speeds. A chestnut with brown leather seats is an attractive choice. It stands out. I've a hero honda super splendor which is nowhere near classic 350 in terms of the feel and comfort.(mileage comparison with it will be foolishness). However, the handle gets jerky and you could barely see the reflection on the mirrors. Engine gets off track at times and the sound becomes annoying. In the long run, it'll be expensive to maintain. Person sitting on the back seat will suffer vibrations within a short distance. Don't even think what long rides could do."
68,1,Comfort to ride First service charges is 900 rupee. Highway mileage is 36 kml. In local ride mileage is 28 to 32. They have no tubeless tyres. There is a main problem to go long trip. Next coming model to give tubeless tyre take it easy And they comes with carburetor engine Air cooled engine To go long not heating issues they open engine.
69,5,"It's a awesome bike. It's long term bike engine efficiency excellent. If you maintain single hand it gives you good performance throughout the life its excellent bike for long route very comfortable bike easy to use now a days the craze of bullet increases day by day and its cost also increasing every year when i purchase it that time it was, 125 now 168."
70,5,1 i buy this bike with emi amount of 70k 2 when i am riding this bike i feel very dignity and proud. Long drive just awesome.3 i love ash color so that's y i buy it and it looks great.4 the royal enfield servicing little bit bad cause they taken our money but not give us back with good experience even they asking money for small works i hope this will company make fine.5 Pros long ride just awesome if you ride this bike you get something. Con: sBack brake liner problem.
71,1,I am having classic 350 bs4 and i purchased this at 4/april/2017  poor performance is giving by that vehicle  this is one of the worst experiences from my side to purchase select a bike of your brand  please first train your employees how to handle the customers and how to resolve the problems of customers.  Poor service giving by your service center in my area  and i am not purchase a single product from your company seriously.
72,1,"Hi, i had booked stealth black 500cc in the state of karnataka karwar but i didn't understand why the bullet is taking too much time to deliver the bike this is horrible i am waiting from 1 month they says stealth black will come with abs so it's taking too much time the royal enfield one of the biggest two wheeler motorcycle company why taking too much time i can't understand."
73,5,It is a comfortable bike for long drive It gives you a feel of king while driving this beautiful bike. You are not going to get tired of riding this bike The average is good if you want to drive a bullet like a king just go for this And the power of bike is enough And the size of its wheel make you feel smooth on road.
74,4,"Style most stylish bike since revolution of bikes, head turner, different looks than plastic bikes.  Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox engine looks good, fuel econoly as per engine is too good.  Ride quality & handling most balanced bike i have seen, very good for off road riding.  Final words can be bought, but extrmely precious.  Areas of improvement need more thump, waiting period.  Pros  looks, pick-up, shockers  cons  extremely pricely , low thump"
75,4,Good riding comfort for minimum speed. Royal is passion for life. I have a top model in classic 350 stealth black. Look is awesome. Service cost is extra for comparatively in bikes. Around 2000 minimum. Slight vibration in the bike handle. This is bs6 version. Starting and acceleration are very good. Back seat is small. I love royal enfield....
76,3,"Style the style is perfect for long rides. Just one thing pinches that the colour is too sensitive. Just a scratch of nail too is enough to damage the look.  Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox engine performance is good, but needs attention towards the oil seals. Clutch and gear box leakages need to be repaired. It shows the lithargy while assembling the bike. Fuel economy is perfect. Gearbox need to be smoothened.  Ride quality & handling perfect.  Final words finishing of the logo, fuel tank cover and the colour is too poor. Rest, the bike is perfect.  Areas of improvement assembly needs to be improved. Plastic cover of the dynamo needs to be replaced with steel.  Pros  engine performance  cons  loose oil-seals and substandard finish/colouring"
77,4,Buying experience was average because they don't celebrate the way another companies do. But who cares because out of all bikes the heaviest and the best durable bike is classic 350 from royal enfield. In terms of pickup average the vehicle is great. But in terms of build quality the bike disappoints because small parts like clutch wire fuses end up very fast which is disappointing but on a average the bike is a beast on indian roads.
78,2,Before writing this i would say that everyone has there own driving experience.  Its been almost 2 year and would like to highlights some below points:  1. Not comfortable for rider and pillion  2. Too much vibration  3. Loose control after 70km  4. Heavy maintenance.  If anyone still like royal enfield and comfortable ride then electra model which has better handle bar position and seat.  Again this is my opinion. Drive well before buying it
79,5,"Awesome bike. I found this bike to be the best ever . Every time while riding this bike i feel much proud to owned this bike . Good job and excellent work to make such a classical look, marvellous job really.... I have a very great experience with this bike while riding on specially highways a great control on high speed really good..."
80,4,vEvery thing is good except its breaking and fuel meter .  1.Its breaking is dull . It has dump break . Its hard to handle sometime. Now days every bike have cost more than 1 lakh should have abs .Its great for breaking .So improve your breaking system.  2. In classic 350 there is no fuel meter .Its important so do that.  3. It has 376cc engine still stuck top speed at 110 . So disappointment on highway .
81,5,"I love the new abs model of royal enfield, the abs works very well and the performance of the bike is very good and i am using the bike from almost a year and there is no complain yet i love to ride this bike and quality of metal used in bike i live in coastal area but there is no rusting in my bike that truly shows the quality of the bike."
82,3,"Got the bike on 2018 december, sold the bike on december 2019. Bike just vibrates once you cross 70 kmph, your hands become numb if you continue riding. Did a road trip from chennai to blore and had to stop atleast 5 times. Takes it's own sweat time to hit 95-100. Pros: good for city, for everyday use to commute to office (45-65 kmph). Not worth the hype, have never understood why people recommend res for long ride/tours.I am happy that i sold this piece of garbage."
83,4,Very good after sale service offered by dealers. Nice bike on road. When go on tour it looks like king of road. Pros: 1) powerful engine 2) good looks 3) classic style 4) it is not a bike it is a status symbol.Cons: 1) fuel meter should be there.2) seats should be more comfortable.3) handle bar should be like that of thunderbird. Else everything is fine.
84,1,"I was a user of tvs bikes. I used tvs bikes for long 30 years. Then i went for this piece of shit (enfield bike) due to family compulsion. Ancillary components of the bike is extremely poor. It run only 9000 km during the last one year (kl 06 g 8211) but i had to change gear cable, clutch wires and accelerator cables, head lamp bulbs for three times). Two times i had to change the break shoe. Horrible and miserable experience. I am a soldier, my request you all ; please do not go for a shit enfield bike. Go for any other brand in India."
85,5,"Royal enfield classic 350 is my dream bike. Its nerve centre of all of my activities, i'm feeling half without it. Its looks are really attractive and rides are smooth. Its usually helpful in long journeys and trips to distant areas of tourism. I'm feeling very happy that i have made good choice of purchasing it."
86,1,I don't have a word to speak about re tappet sound has made me to sell so i sold the bike  the service of re is too bad in some city like ulhasnagar i suggest my friends not to buy re  being a biker i had a bad experience while riding the re classic 350  my suggestion is not to buy this bike until the issue gets resolve but re
87,5,"Usually, if you go to any showroom, may it be selling anything, until you buy something (i mean until you pay) the sales guys will be very attentive to the customer. They will be at your service the moment you think of them!Then, there is royal enfield, these guys think their bikes are made in heaven! they behave like they are selling lamborghini! (esp in indiranagar and marathalli. Bangalore.But other showrooms are better than them. I’m not saying you will love the experience though! )Now, think of your situation fast forward 4 months after you get your bike! you will have those little irritating breakdown/troubles with that poorly built bike. Will that service center which didn’t care for you even before your payment give attention now? no! i n the broad day light, you have jumped into the well which you saw in the dark . Beware! i’m talking out of experience. Who ever has got brain, won’t buy a re second time. Now, before its too late, decide whether you want to buy this piece of metal paying that"
88,5,"I bought this bike 10 months ago. Ash classic 350, salesman gave keys and asked to wear helmet and started clicking photos. . . . . . . . A proud moment. . . . I don't know what happened. Friends got happy that our group got royal enfield at least... But. . I faced the issues. As i was getting average of 35 somehow gone to 28. Fuel over in mid highway. Then road assistance service given by royal enfield. After all. Riding royal enfield is always a proud movement for everyone..A sign of Indian army."
89,1,3.5 month waiting was there to buy this.  Riding is okay but you cant ride it roughly if you try there is lots of problems comes to you.  Engine is very poor.  Self wearings approx 5500 rs. And two times changed in 3 years.  Chain sets approx 2100 rs and changed two times in 20000 kilometers.  Soccer's are also cheap.  Alignment of tyre worst. Always touch with mudguard.  Abnormal sounds comes from electric plugs and from engine.  Overall if you have own service center then okay. On every 2000 km. It will take 5000rs money for its service if you ride it tightly.
90,5,You feel like a royal person when you ride the royal enfield. And the look of royal enfield is amazing. And performance is excellent. Once you ride the royal enfield you never want to ride another bike. And the servicing charges and maintenance charges is also low. So thank you.
91,4,"I feel very proud to own my dream bike from my childhood. Some people are saying about mileage, it doesn't made for mileage, when i was kid, i saw most of high income agriculture people, and military people. Thanks for re to reach everyone with specification adjustments and dream come true. Regular maintenance must for re. Please maintain and ride cool inside the city. Outer road can go fast as per your driving capacity."
92,5,"It is a very good bike best in every scene it has a great mileage of 35 kmpl it is a great mileage bike comes with bs6 engine with electric start this is awesome bike till i have bought 5 bikes at the age of 21 but the greatest one is royal enfield only. This bike feels as legend and alive. After riding this bike i will say you that this bike is the perfect definition of comfort, legendary, high rated, and.....Too many good things."
93,1,Royal enfiled company service is untrusted don't buy this bike . This company has not value of customer. This company is 3rd class company i think 3rd class also better on this company. Totally loss of money of customer. Java is better than royal enfield service also good java bike. Don't buy royal enfield. Its pure waste of money.
94,5,My buying experience is totally awesome. Riding a classic 350 on off road is too good. My classic 350 is gunmetal grey colour And my bike is sindhudurg first colour first bike. Maintenance is not expensive. The main cons is tank cap enters the water lightly in rainy season this is a main cons of royal enfield.
95,3,"Buying experience was good but i have to wait for around a month.My riding experience was good as i expected but i faced many problems .I love this bike very much and the performance,mileage is good. But it gets dirty very quickly and sometime gears gets struck, bike didn't get start in one push, sometime it doesn't show neutral indicator.Braking is fair enough.Silencer gets to hot and it is dangerous to the pillion rider.The bike is quite heavy but salute for royal enfield for balancing the bike.Service cost is ok but to maintain the bike is little bit expensive.Pros....1. Good mileage 2. Good performance.3. Good royal look 4. Good for touring.5. Can be customised. 6. Most accessories in the market. cons.....1.High maintenance cost.2.Fuel meter is missing.3.Silencer get too hot.4.Price is little bit higher."
96,4,I purchased this bike on 23 august 2017. After waiting for just 15 days. (jugad se) . I bought it on bank finance.  I feel this bike good. 560 km till now. Did not run it over 60 km as 1st service not done yet and riders manual suggests so. But before reading the manual i pushed it upto 100 km/h. Waaw really great experience. That day i felt that upto 60 it looks like the machine is moving in sleep no load at all. And it reached to 100 with no efforts in seconds. I have feeded it with petrol cost rs 1240/- some 17.50 litres and still in main fuel . Silage in mid thirties i guess. People really take a turn to have a look on it.  I think it will be better if sound of thump would be louder like in old r.E.S . Engine clicking sound and vibrations don't give a great feeling.  The bike is good. Expect even better experience after the very first service done.  Dream wait ended after years. I ride the royal motorcycle i wished for years.
97,1,I have classic 350 2017 model. Problem is pick up problem. Some times good pick up and sometimes its like tvs excel. I complained 4 times in head office. Every time they say to give it to service centre. I given so many times. But still now no pick up. Its very bad. I never expected this from royal enfield
98,4,"Classic 350 is a great bike from an Indian manufacturer royal enfield. Its there in the Indian market for the past 9 years. This vehicle weighs around 190kgs. Well this bike has its pros and cons.Pros; good stability, Very good mileage, I get around 35-40kmplVery comfortable vehicle. Cons; weighs around 190kgs. More weight reliability is 8 on 10, cost per service will be a bit high than other brands."
99,5,One of the best bike and i have brought gun metal grey and its look is very good and when i drive it its experience is very good bike power and pickup is very good and whenever i drive it from road of mandla it looks very dashing and its make very impressive impact on viewers . Guys really it's awesome bike.
100,4,"Fine bike, but some issues with the handle bar.. Whenever i try to gain speed over 60, the handle start to shiver.. So that even the side view mirror become very tough to see, otherwise all other specification is pretty much good and seating is perfect and very much comfort.. My mother and aged peoples are very much comfort in sitting on classic 350...Overall its a good bike... But have to correct some issues like handle shivering."
101,3,"My bike model is 2017. For 1 year no problem after that we want face lot issue. And mileage problem also coming after 1 year for 30kmpl. Noisy engine after 1-2 yrs! rusting issue! is it worth buying re ? just for looks and feelings? re should think about people, what they expect in 1.6 lakh rupees, look into this..."
102,3,"1.I really excited when i owned a royal enfield classic 350cc .I had been waited above a year to get this bike 2. Really excited performance while riding. It make me feel that i'm the boss on road. 3. Mass look, energetic performance 4. Service and maintenance cost is high and we must care and strict about screws on engine to avoid engine oil leakages when service and after riding too far km5. Pros - much wait protect me from accident causing little scratch, looks beautiful, comfortable for family trip.Cons - main cons is 350cc in single cylinder, high vibration, less mileage, high heat, drum and disk break, spokes wheel, tube tyres, side lock is not updated, can be easily stolen because of old tech on ignition."
103,5,I love my bike.Price is very less then the bike value.I love the sound when i'm riding.I have more than 1000 pics with my bike.I have no single issue still.If you love the bike riding buy this one.One disadvantage is there you're addicted with royal enfield... This is the best bike. I love this one.
104,5,As every re owner knows buying it is a long wait . Riding experience is good at cruising speed of 80-90kph . Look wise it is gone attract all. Great performance in hills. Service is cheap and team is assistive. Vibration has been reduced .Top speed performance is bad in this segment.Overall a good beast.
105,3,I don't prefer the classic 350 anymore.... Was so mad about this bike before i own it... Its not a better choice for a long ride.. Its riding comfort is bit low.. The troubles are with the seating comfort both the front and back.... And the other problem is with the vibration... Its vibrating terribly that we will get irritated...And the maintenance is the next problem...Moreover i suggest as well as i prefer classic 500 or standard 500 now..
106,4,I brought this model in the year 2016. Till now i have completed 12400 kms on it. If the maintenance is done in a proper manner then this is more reliable compared to others. Sitting comfort is not up to the point. Looks are great when kept as it is from the beginning. Mileage may be less than other bikes but x-factor is the power and looks. I love it.... :)
107,5,"It is a best bike for ride .1.The showroom was pretty cool interior with black design and good behavioral employees workers.2.Best for any kind of road with good speed 3.Royal look ,my gun grey colour is damn cool excellent on road performance 4.Service is good little bit late but good 5.Fuel economy is not that good with speed and in city. 6.For long drive the best bike for me."
108,4,Royal enfield..... Now a days the name is enough..... I got best experience from it because riding experience of the classic 350 is overwhelming..... N awesome ..... The performance of the engine is very high class..... I love my bike...... It's my way to express my freedom while riding the classic n it will never get you down.....
109,1,"If you want to use belt on your Spine in your young age you should definitely go for a Royal Enfield Classic generator.. There is no word called repair for the RE mechanics only replace. No perfect fuel indicator till now. No led set up. Less power. Only good thing is - made off of metal . One word- Bakwass invention which plays with costumer's feelings,money and patience."
110,5,"Buying experience is excited to see classic 350. Riding experience is so good Good looking and best m best performance. The royal enfield classic 350 recently received a range of official accessories to improve usability and also to enhance its looks. They include alloy wheels, knuckle guards, luggage racks and a headlight guard. These add-ons come with a 2-year warranty as standard."
111,1,"Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox  engine noises - i have been hearing some weird noises from engine since day 1. The technicians from royal enfield say the noises will disappear as i put on more and more kms in the odo meter. Currently the odo reading is 4200kms and i don't know how many more kms i have put on the odo to make the noises disappear. Also i have been hearing some knocking sound from primary chain case, to which royal enfield doesn't have any solution.  Ride quality & handling  vehicle wobbling - royal enfield technicians worked on this issue for couple of months and till now they don't have any concrete solution for this. Technicians did all kinds of things - truing, checking vertical bends, checking horizontal bends etc. But to no avail.  Vibrations - i experience severe vibrations while riding around 80kmph. Literally i find it difficult to hold the handle. Till now no solution is provided for this issue.  Rear fender rubbing against rear tyre - i have been experiencing this since"
112,5,"I was born in a middle class family but my bike made me royal this is the first thing i want to share with you then all vehicles have it's own merits and demerits bit in my case i also do some mistakes in my home so i don't think about that failures for all it is a engine buy for me it's my heart i love my bike the major feel i get this bike is it's dug dug dug sound and that vibration and the weight my bike also love me because she don't put me down even long rides.She is ready to pic me everywhere in this world, the look is so amazing and the service and maintenance cost is low, all can manage it i Love my bike and i'm thankful to the marikar showroom kollam."
113,4,"Its very decent bike to buy got a mileage in city is 38 and highway 45. Royal look seating is very comfort heavy weight of bike as my height is 6'1 tall riders it is very good abs performance is good very cheap maintaining bike compared to this 350 cc segment. Mine is redditch red, it way looks is better."
114,5,"Royal enfield as a brand i really feel like royal comfort with royal performance. I had ride many bikes like hero,bajaj and tvs but when i purchased the royal enfield bike it makes my choice a little bit different it provides me really a royal look. When i ride it ,i am amazed with it's performance. It's runs as smooth as a gel pen on paper. I am from town area where the roads are toughest challenge for any bike to show there performance. But with my royal enfield 350 it is not a big it runs smoothly on roads as well as field."
115,1,"I used this bike from 4 year for my daily routine Every parts of RE are to expensive n cheap quality High maintenance bike have to much vibration after 90kmph and RE Service centre it's not familiar they are not well trained most of them are irresponsible if your budget is 2lakh better to go for Dominar,Mojo,KTM now am a proud owner of Dominar it's really Worth it..."
116,5,"Be royal only on royal enfield an amazing bike i liked it is best and comfortable for family , student and mainly it is comfortable sitting behind the bike for senior citizens and royal enfield classic proved to be my desire fulfilling bike. I choose royal enfield because of its elegant design, performance, engine thump and all above its royal legacy which has been carried out for decades. Though, I had other options as well but i preferred choosing the beast over the goats. It has tremendous style possessing the macho feel as while riding you don't feel like riding a regular one because u are on the beast. As far as performance and mileage is concerned, i can take out a 40+ average even in city traffic. The bike feels a little bulky and clutch stiffens once hands get pain in the traffic for the initial rider. So you can't complain, because if you are complaining then it's like asking a beast to treat you gently. Hence for me, it's not a big deal. I have been using this machine for more than 5 months and rod"
117,4,"Well, this is a well-known motor bike in our country. Not much to say about it though. But here is a very basic review from a automobile enthusiast. This is my second re bike after machismo during my college days.I use it mostly for in-town riding (not daily commute) and for long rides or trips. This is a nice bike to own considering the price point. Now if you want more then you need to pay more. So don't crib about it. Ride quality and handling is good and you will love it if you take it on a long spin. (the pillion rider seat can be improved)Coming to the looks, riding pleasure and mechanisms - they are decent. Re is adding on new features as well on a timely basis.Now the buying experience and after sales service for re bikes in general. Here, in this space, i find there is a lot of room and scope for improvement. It could be ironed out keeping in mind the real good service quality and customer friendly attitude : ) After all, the service quality is an integral part of the entire automobile manufacturing"
118,5,Pros :- (1) it is good in mileage of 43kmpl.  (2) when you ride it feels like awesome.  (3) it gives you class  (4) its looks are just fantastic  Cons :- (1) the only problem is their is no fuel meter (indicator) so you have to put petrol when it comes to reserve mode.  Summary - best buy for all bike lovers its just awesome must buy
119,4,Buying experience was not that good enough because in silchar classic 350 is in high demand so you have to wait (q) .While riding i feel like i am the one an only boss on the road.Looks that i don't need to say everybody knows that very well. (awesome) while i ride the bike near market area everybody stare at me and my bike.Performance is at its best One an only cons is fuel efficiency. But due to 350cc engine you can't see that as a cons.
120,5,My father bought it for me from Raghu Ram Auto Care . The buying experience was really good everyone talked very nicely and cooperated very well. I would like to start from the pros.- 1. Very Eye catchy. 2. Very smooth ride and comfortable as I am 6 feet . 3. Gives a great mileage if ran smoothly. The max I got is 47 km/l. 4. Balance. 5. Power. It could move in hills to Rocky areas very smoothly. Con- 1. I don't recommend it for short height people as at times they get misbalanced . But they can buy if they really want to. 2. Weight. ( It's a pro also) 3. Brakes. I felt the sandstone model has got better brakes.
121,5,First i was a bit confused between royal enfield and r15. But after getting a test drive i got to know the comfort level of this bike. It tops all other bikes in its range. In fact the best cruiser bike on its range. Its engine power is insane. Despite being a 350cc it gives an amazing mileage. The only con it has is in its look. Because the look has not changed since long.
122,5,"It's a low-cost complete packaged bike which delivers passion and style with its owners itself , design in better , performance is good ,low maintenance and good for riding for long drive specially for mountains ,better controls ,super smooth and very stylish , now a days it's a common bike for youths .Need to do something about silences and fuel injector system of bike ,rest everything is ok, i am a owner of classic 500 and 350 desert storm . And i am loving it ."
123,1,"I had to wait for 6 month for delivery, even after paying 1.5lac showroom people hardly seem supportive. Riding is good, just keep spare clutch and accelerator wire as they tend to brake regardless of road condition. Service centre those are maintained by re are worst place to repair your bike, if you have option of independent service always go to that place instead of re service centre as post service one more trip to service centre is compulsory and they will make sure that your working parts should also stop working. Pros: legacy (not aware how long it will continue)Cons: service, spare parts, and extremely high cost to ownership."
124,4,"1.Buying experience of these bike excellent as compared to other bikes we have to wait for at least two months and if we early it is good.2.When riding an bullet you feel like royal ,king and the experience feel we are getting is too good it is like emotion more than enough.3.Looks like gunman and royal look4.This not bad.5.Pros -seating position is more comfortable, royal look, exhaust sound thumb cons-vibrations at higher speed, mileage, weight is on heavier side."
125,2,"Style  its really looks sexy .  Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox  the engine performance is ok. Fuel economy is good and gearbox is worst. Every time when i change ma gear i hear some weird sound from it. Some time the gear doesnt shif properly only. Even the service centres in bangalore are really pathethic. They dont know how to service the bike properly. But charge a huge lumpsum amount. I have asked the garage felow to sort out the problem of my gear box and still he is not interested in listening and he postponds the service date.  Ride quality & handling  the quality of ride is pretty good but when the bike crosses 80kmph it vibrates a lot creating a numb feeling in the hands. Also pillon riders find it difficult to sit as the comfortness is really poor. When it comes to thehandling it is quite good.  Final words  royal enifield has to do a lot of research in solving the problems related to gear box, chain as well as handle vibration. And please dont manufacture a bike in sake of making mon"
126,3,The vintage style is perfectly masculine comfortable for even long distances however there are fields were lot of developments are in tyre need of like the clutch (there is always some issue with clutch resulting in bad gear shifts )Next issue with the bike is it’s top speed it take enough time to cross 100 km/hr and if ever it crosses 100 mark there is a lot of annoying vibration going in the bike.
127,1,"Delivery is too late. They have gave delivery date after booking the bike no response from showroom that when we get bike. Not at all received calls also.. Bike is good but the sales people are very irresponsible. We are not happy with the showroom, bad name for royal enfield cause of the sales persons."
128,1,"1. Its ok ok. 2. Riding is good but vibration is too high.3. Looks good4. Servicing and maintenance cost is too much. In every service they say this you have to refit or change it. The labour cost is too high. Once I serviced they count 2600rs. Only for labour cost. If they fit new clutch wire they claim total cost of 250 rs. Approx. In that the wire cost is 150 rs. And labour cost they count 100rs. (for example). I spent 50,000+ in five years service. 5. Never buy this bike. Worst experience ever. Go for jawa its nice bike."
129,5,This is the best bike i have ever seen.Its engine and look is unbelievable. I am very interested in this bike.It has excellent brakes.Its voice dug dug is best one.All bikes are just like cat in front of this.I will understand this bike.I recommend all friends to buy this bike and enjoy life and thrill in adventure.
130,5,"I have a bs3 classic 350, its original thump is nice to hear. Then i changed to short bottle silencer which sounds like vintage bullet and the performance is good, mileage also decent but the bs6 bullets are totally disappointed. the dug dug beat is missing in bs6 bullets and the bhp is reduced...Bs3 &bs4 bullets are ruling the roads.. my brother having 1985 model bullet such a chopper..addictive beat but the mileage is 28kms then the top speed is not impressive and that's why i am owned bs3 bullet."
131,5,"When you planning to buy this beauty you should not consider its cost, this machine is fabulous in all colours. This machine is designed for long tour especially.Attractive design with good performance. I don't find cons in this machine except it's sitting posture, but it's sitting posture makes you feel you owned something beautiful.If anybody plans to buy new one,i would suggest to go for bullet instead some plastic or fiber."
132,1,"I own 2015 classic 350 and i've been regretting that decision for a long time now. The main reason is that re bikes are not for everyone cause every person has different taste in bikes but ends buying an re because of it's thump and retro looks, that's the major mistake they'll make and ends up regretting it.Major issues are: 1. Vibrations - oh man you can't get rid of it and it's starts when the engine is on. The mirrors are useless because you can't see anything cause of vibrations. I changed my stock mirrors three times! because the mirror get broken of vibrations.2. Maintenance- average cost of 2500 is spent for every service which is costly considering it rivals. Once i didn't ride my bike for a month and got some problems when it came back from service the bill was for 8000 !!! my 2018 maruti dzire got serviced last week and the bill was less than 6k, considering this it's absolute waste of money to spend it on re. 3. Mileage - i get average of 32-35 on city and highway. 4. Highway - you can't go above"
133,5,"This is really an amazing beast. On road it is like a beast and other two wheelers gets aside just listening after the voice. While riding it feels like i am the bond.Grip on road, speed is furious and very good control on road. People know you by your enfield. Really amazing and 5 stars to this beast.My best choice by selecting this beast."
134,5,Its very easy to buying... I have ride so many bikes. Make me proud we can not explain the feelings in words while ride with my bullet. I had ridden from noida to manali.. It was a great trip some of the bikes are dump in between the trip but my royal was cross the limits.
135,5,This bike is a very good for long ride bike seat is very good and comfortable this maximum speed is goes to 140 km and the mileage is 37 km i will also suggest you to buy this bike and the minimum emi in India is 15572 rs to all you should take this bike and is look good this bike is very good thank you.
136,5,Classic 350 is not the bike who will take speed of 100kmph in just 5 second it keeps you safe.You will experience a amazing riding with with royal touch..It's not the expansive than its feeling.Very suitable for long drive and..Now the self start feature is very useful.This is not a bike this is a member of my family .
137,3,"What we get in 1.6 lakh ? tube tyre which we get difficulties when there is puncture while touring! no fuel indicator! noisy engine after 1-2 yrs! rusting issue! is it worth buying re ? just for looks and feelings? re should think about people, what they expect in 1.6 lakh rupees, look into this..."
138,2,Royal enfield is a brand but now this brand in only in name. I have classic 350 and this bike is not very good. One way problem is a very serious problem in this bike. Carburetor which uses in royal enfield is of bajaj pulsar 150cc. Self problem is also in royal enfield classic 350 model.But it has muscular look which only attract people to bye enfield otherwise nothing good in new royal enfield models
139,5,"1.Engine is very powerful upto 95kmph And comfort is good upto 100kmph speed.2.Seat comfortable for long rides easily .3. Mileage is amazing for that high cc engine its 40kmpl ,if you travel in 80kmph and 35kmpl for 90 and above speed.4.Head lamp is simply classic and high power lamp Instrument cluster is simple and little more increased 5.Nice breaking in new versions with abs system."
140,1,"Style  nice in style and looks  engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox  very bad engine value and gearbox. Parts getting break down very soon. Fuel economy is efficient  ride quality & handling  fine. Nice for long rides infact. But not like thinderbird  final words  go for standard instead. Or buy old bikes not new. Old bullets are quite long lasting and good in quality spare parts.  Areas of improvement  their engine parts quality getting lowered by days. High maintenance cost for everything. Genuine parts are available at sky high price. Local parts not available.  Pros  royal enfield brand  cons  engine quality, parts quality"
141,2,Worst ever service ever received from royal enfield as well as dealer  yamuna agencies adoor kerala  . I have contacted to book re 350 chestnut and received a confirmation as they have stock of that color and can be delivered within 2 weeks .I am ready to pay 50k as initial and balance as finance so i paid 5000rs as advance and after 2 days after the approval of finance they called me for the balance payment of 45000rs .After all the payment they are not calling back and not answering the calls .Everywhere managers are to solve the problems but in this place no hope from the that person also. Near to 1 month i received the bike ( 17/06/2019) and until now i didn't received my no plate . I raised this issue to re also and the response is worst than dealer. Still i am waiting for response from anyone.Worst worst service from re agencies.
142,5,I saw lot of negative reviews above yes of course royal enfield too has pros and cons but if u want the royal enfield to be like duke its not possible this is classic that is streets what i am going to say is choose the bike according to u r physical personality royal enfiled are need a good care and maintenance its not meant for fast ride the comfort its the main motto so if u want your ride to be comfortable smooth then go for royal enfield its one of the amazing bike for indian roads and more features compered to harley with less price . The company is there for more than 50 years and had set lots of record in riding and also world record in stunts so i am very happy to be a rider of royal enfield made like a gun.
143,3,This bike is a nice option for casual use and for fun rides but its heavy weight sometimes becomes a problem for daily commute because its very difficult for a daily commuter to handle such a heavy bike as it can be very tiring for a person to handle a 200 kg bike.I bought it for my daily usage but its heavy weight is now becoming a problem for me.
144,5,Best bike for daily commute. But not a good bike for rainy season. My bike has too many problems. When you fill petrol more than 400 rupees the bike doesn't start and run well. I had brake issues too. For no reason the brake will not work properly. When you park your bike in rain means the water will enter your bike's ignition wire and the bike won't start . It tools nearly more time thank you think to start over the bike again in rainy days. Bike just needs many improvement in many aspects. But for a middle class family i don't suggest this bike. Buy a good bike.
145,1,"I have purchased royal enfield classic-350 efi- gun metal grey bs6 engine bike on 19/01/2020 from north delhi motorcycles-520. I am so happy that finally i have purchased my dream bike which have planned last 2 years. But unfortunately, i have faced so many problems in few days:-Clutch plate damage after running only 129 km. silencer color change to abnormal- change to dark red and brown color. lose wiring issues, horn was not working while driving.Pickup issue-due to clutch problem in bike. gear problem- while changing gear it stuck most of the times. while running 1-2 km, silencer over heated as compare to other same modal bike. So it is sign of over heating of engine. Which may occur major problem in bike. Engine overheating & thus engine seizure symptoms are there.I completely shock that all above problems come in my new bike which run only 129 km. Being royal enfield a big brand, company always promised to satisfy the customers in sense of durability and comfort. Whereas i am not satisfied and my trust"
146,5,"I bought royal enfield classic-350 after overall wait of 1 month from the booking date. Mine one year ownership is awesome only with slight general repairs. When my odo turned 15,000km i got my service billing amount around 6,000 that’s the only thing i felt bad! except the maintenance charges bike is awesome!  Handle moment and vibration must be manage a little more"
147,5,"1 very good experience while buying the bike 2 best bike for riding 3 best bike in world for looks and performance 4 everyone is helpful while servicing and maintenance in service center and do there work properly5 there is no disadvantage of this bike, it is the best bike in the world with lots of advantages."
148,5,"Ride ability High torque at low rpm means maximum pulling power from low revolutions, making a ride uphill or your daily commute effortless.In the classic, heritage and time-tested performance go hand in hand. Its dashing, vintage-inspired looks are underscored by an enfield trademark - dependability.The classic is a machine you can count on, come hill, dale or plain. It has the torque to flatten mountains and persevere through entire ranges.Ride home the royal enfield classic with emi starting as low as inr 2,490* per lakh. Avail exciting exchange offers on your old motorcycle."
149,5,"I take her for trekking and night camps, she never got a scratch and always was comfortable to go on rocky mountains and bumpy roads.As named its a classic. Doesn't require much maintenance even after so rough usage.Its heavy yet the most powerful vehicle to take anywhere on any road with less effort."
150,5,Best mileage and maintenance is very costly and material quality is very best classic 350 and break system is best all good quality is best in royal infield bullet is powerful vehicle and very best and very good looking so much and riding and handling quality is best and almost everything looks nice.
151,1,Ahh! no pros. Started facing issue from the first month. In comparison to other 2 wheeler it is worst bike. 20th century old technology with bugger service and service centre. If you want to waste your money den buy this bike. I bought it in Feb 2018 and it was the start of never ending story to go to service centre.
152,1,"Today (01.01.2018) while driving my royal enfield bike's chain sprockets broken suddenly, just escaped from a major accident.  When i contacted the royal enfield showroom, they are very much irresponsible and casually saying that these are not covered under warranty.  There is no where my mistake in this, as it is a new bike not more than 8 months old, and just crossed 12000 kms.  I have all the necessary documents also up to date service done at the showroom still , its suddenly broken when i'm on road in 60 kms speed, if something happened to me then who will be responsible.  Chain sprockets seems to be of very poor in quality , if not then how it will get broken in this much short period of time.  I was a proud owner of royal en-field and now feeling shame because on the quality and the way of response from the showroom.  Company should take the responsibility for this as we are trusting and investing so much of money , and is it to get such a cheap quality product"
153,5,"Hi!! every one this is worth information to all who wants to buy royal enfield classic 350 it is one of the best bike for the Indian roads as i enjoyed comfort, style, road grip and even more love u bullet and one more thing i would like to say is for Indian pot hole, humps and kaccha road traffic this is the best one guy please say yes to royal enfeild"

155,5,"I bought classic 350 in 2015 ash colour After riding 16,000km in 5 years It’s really good bike It gives such a feeling while riding The vibration of this bike only gives little very Apart from that really well Mileage around 35 to 40 km i getting for normal roads. In hill station it gives massive feeling to ride the bike Apart from vibrant everything is good I used to go for college in this bike weekly twice."
156,5,I purchased gun metal 350 classic it looks like a bullet coming from the gun and while riding the bike it feels like sitting on the elephant and having ride and its cost is also avarage 1.80k. I had a ride in mountains and in sand it will never get struck and gives smooth ride. And bike speed also very good in bs 3 while speeding the bike it will get vibrate but in bs 4 it will never get vibrate. I will never feel bore on this bike good servicing but it cost more for oil changing and some repair while getting for service.
157,5,"Really, it is enjoyable to ride. It makes me feel that i am being seen and respected. It is fabulous smooth to ride. I have never got tired by riding. It make me feel that i have a great asset. Where ever i go i am being attracted and inquired about it so i could feel i have something special in me and good decision maker.Really i am very proud of having it.Thank you."
158,4,It's a very different feeling always when you ride royal enfield the bike is good for long distance travels for tours and rides but sometimes vibrations are more in bike...Bikes performance is overall very good and i guess you don't bother about looks and price while buying the royal enfield because it is comes with classic and really dashing looks.
159,5,"Awesome bike for cruising . Give a royal feeling like riding on a elephant and it's comfort level is ultimate .Never get tired while riding on it .Power is awesome , can go an anywhere without any problem and it best for people who want to feel power .There is no bike like this. Specially it's sound is awesome fat fattttttttt.....I will love to own this bike...."
160,4,"I bought it this year and really loving it, if u are thinking for a bike for town ride then this may be your bike.Till now i have traveled 700 km in this bike and really it's awesome.Pros :1.It is comfortable, 2.It gives u a royal look, 3.The sound gives u a sense of power that the engine releases ,4.Color options are available, 4.Full metal, 5.Shiny look (if maintained properly), 6.Mileage is also good. Cons:1.Too much weight, 2.Price is little bit higher than standard version of this, 3.Rusting( if not maintained properly), 4.No digital meter, 5.No fuel gauge, 6.Vibration."
161,3,Bike looks always old fashion..Need to update the bike look. #performance is just ok....Starting very slow top end also bad....We can't use proper engine braking of this bike Vibration in the engine at higher rpm.It's though to ride this one in traffic Acceleration is slow...Even 150 cc bike acceleration is pretty good then the bullet.
162,5,"1. Since the authorised dealer is in bhilwara, it is very easy to get the bike purchased.  2. My longest ride on it was 300km and it was so smooth.  3. Red colour made it too cool.  4. It takes a lot time to clean the whole bike ;)  5. Overall it is good. Since the mileage of bike is good it is great deal in that budget."
163,5,"This two wheeler is too amazing for the ride, and looks also too good. Also so many accessories available to make-up the bullet, good mileage and easy to maintain. Required one thing should be changed in bullet that is seats, rider and pillion rider seat are not comfortable for the long ride (above 50 km)."
164,4,"Riding very comfort also in affordable price.  Only do the servicing on time , also maintain tyre pressure, & fill the fuel by auto cut for good average.  Good looking also feel when you drive it look like a king on road . Good performance overall like average, breaking & in city traffic.  Now service cost also in reach & spare part not costly now company provide all the services in very reasonable price. I recommend this bike for young & old all type peoples."
165,3,1.Buying experience is good one.  2.Riding experience:- first time its feel good but vibration of engine is horrible. It's vibrates badly and it affect our hand and back.Bike feels more power and diver seat is good but back seat is not ok. The back seat is not suited for long rides.  3.Looks are very very good.But we have to take the effort to keep the look.Rust is the problem. Performance of bike is good but the vibration kills.  4.Service and maintenance:- my 6 the service over the last week. I done all my services @ marikar triangulum. For each service we can expect a scratch on body. My 5 the service experience is bad. They forget to fill the enough engine oil to my bike. So be careful about their service. Before taking the bike after service check all the things even engine oil level too.  now i completed the 13 thousand kms. I changed front disc pad last month and also need to change the chain sprocket. Rear break linear are need to change frequently. I talked to mechanic he said due to engine vibratio
166,1,"I am using since one year...This is worst bike ..Back pain and neck pain called from classic 350cc bike.. Maintenance cost is equal to mercedes benz level..Looks very smart ..Up to 60 kilometers ride, automatically hand shaking. Over vibration called engine ....This bike not comfort...Etc etc ......."
167,1,Sound is very bad look like three wheeler sound.I m very sad after buying this bike.There is some problem in my bike and its 45 days old. I m facing this sound issue from the beginning when i bought this bike.There is lot of difference in between same model when i compare with the other bike.I was thinking it will fix after first service but its still there
168,5,This is the best bike i ever ride  It is good for long tour it give you comfort  And the royal feeling ..........  This is my first bike and this is my favourite  Long ride and handling is good mainly the comfort witch other bike can't give  Heavy body sign of bike .......  I got it on black colour ...
169,5,"Wonderful / always feel royal and a king type feel while riding. Great look, marvelous performance, always serviced and less maintenance required. A great vehicle. I own classic 350 and it is a wonderful bike to ride on. I wish to advise to make it a bit light and fuel-efficient with more mileage per liter petrol with more cylinder power and latest technology."
170,5,"Awesome ride quality, you will have a great experience riding this bike. The name is only needed royal. It feels royal the road presence is awesome. Riding this bike in highway will be very comfortable. The seats are very soft.Awesome ride quality, you will have a great experience riding this bike. The name is only needed royal. It feels royal the road presence is awesome. Riding this bike in highway will be very comfortable. The seats are very soft."
171,5,1.Too easy to buy 2.Riding experience awesome 3. Killer looks 4. Quick service. People who are talking about mileage in bullet ....Please go and fetch a 150 cc bike which gives a 60 kmpl ...When you are going for a bullet ... you shouldn't have to bother about the mileage ...Its royal look ..Strong body ...And that sound of the engine ...Changing the silencer for that sound could effect the mileage...Overall its performance is too good.
172,5,I have a dream to buy the royal enfield and i love to ride the bike and looks are amazing and performance was good and pros are better riding experience and so far i ride this bike and comfortable ride and royal feeling when i ride and mostly the design was amazing and mileage is also good and finally it is amazing bike.
173,1,"After using various bikes like CBZ,R15S etc i Bought this bike Redditch Blue BS4 in 2018. Delivered without fuel (stopped after 4kms ride from showroom),after complaining,the dealer simply denied their fault. Dealer will focus only to hike your service bill amount. My experience, don't waste your money in the name of RE. Instead buy Splendor which will be highly durable and value for money...."
174,5,"Style rough & tough bike with great look.  Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox superb engine with good performance. 40 Kmpl with not bad gear shifting.  Ride quality & handling superb ride quality with rough handling initially.. After my first service all went good, no problem in handling.  Final words re should reduce waiting period, most of them hates on aiting period and moving to other brands. Hope new plant may solve this isssue.  Areas of improvement  * need to reduce vibration.  * Engine noise should be reduced (re is famous for this)  * waiting period  * need more attention on service.  Pros  styling, comfort, shocks, engine, dug dug dug  cons  vibration, gear shifting"
175,4,"Listen everybody, buying is very easy but most important is after sales service. When i bought this classic 350 from somewhere in solapur, the bike made worst noise.After trying hard for about 8 months to get thing resolved,i was loosing hope. Then there was dhone auto near market yard. Guys the engineers and staff at this dealer was really superb.Superb in listening to your problems,superb technical team,superb problem solving skills. My bike was totally restored and now i get the smoothest ride and the mileage is 52 km/lit. They personally looked in this matter."
176,2,1 this is only ok ok.... Royal enfield is not giving anything with the bike there is no petrol meter in this bike not crossing 112km/hr. 2 riding experience is good but vibration is very high u should have to tight all parts on weekly basis. 3 look is good after market modifications and pain is very bad.... 4 maintenance is not very expensive. Everything is good but i will give it 3 star.
177,5,"Very nice bike...And cool engine ...It gives more pleasure when ride the bike and it gives longer seat , during long drive i can't tired...Hi today i am reviewing for bullet classic 350 the bullet 350 is better than bullet 500. The bullet 350 mileage is 35 kmpl. Bullet its very heavy look and its pickup the speed very fast bullet bike is dream bike i liked bullet.Its not comfortable to 14-15 year old people.The bullet drive is very hard but no problem in bullet given disc brake and very short breaking system and its make very comfortable bike the bullet look is very big bike. We like bullet."
178,5,I never owned this. But it's very comfortable for many rids for example tour's and long ride also. Best mileage 35+ in this price segment this bike good in looks and also power of royal enfield 350 i saw many people while riding this bike i very excited to ride this 1 day i rides from my friend bike so it was very good in looks also has an power also. A bike can take and go to you for many tours with 2 people's can ride comfortably. I'm from hyderabad so i have seen many bikes but many people's are changed their exhaust for sound. It gives a lot of sound but it's a sound pollution for everyone for also birds can disturb on this sounds. I hope a royal enfield can change the sound of this bike.
179,5,"I bought the bike 3 months(july, 2016) back and rode 3000 km till now. Its really an amazing bike. Its the airavatha. I feel like the maha raja when i sit on it. Excellent ride comfort and seating position. Fuel economy is 37 kmpl in city(bangalore) and 42-45 on high ways.  I have done some research like any other men/women before buying. Finally decided to go with classic 350 black. I think every bike has some things to be consider with it.  I dont have any magor compalints to say about my bike. These are some findings from my 3 months experience with classic 350.  Gear box was a little hard initially, hitting neutral was difficult but after first servicing its really smooth.  Vibrations are high when you hit 100 km speed. Also it vibrates when you chnage gear and slow down speed suddenly.  I donno what material they have used in making the seats, but they are really hard. Butts burns when you go for long rides.  Though fuel indicator is not there, i never had any problem with it.  If you have a thin person"
180,5,It's a best for riders who like to cruise longways and long roots day night mileage is also pretty much good on highway i almost got 43 kilometer per hour. Only the improvement this bike need is the rear disc brake should be there instead of drum brake.Very comfortable and gorgeous ride.Best for off roading special in mumbai when the roads are potholes in rainy season.
181,1,"Buying experience was not so good, you have to book for the same in advance. Also they don't give bill for the full amount you paid and no option to avoid extra cost like locks and helmet. Riding is comfortable but sometime vibration is so much irritating and harming hands, its better to go for other bike. Pickup is very poor, its sounds bad in traffic when it suddenly stop and making noise in engine like something stuck. Further mileage you can't actually check as there is no fuel meter and stop anywhere without knowing how much fuel left. Servicing and maintenance is very high and charge additional cost then mrp in the name of labour charges."
182,1,"I had purchased on 1.72020 from my city royal enfield dealer and after just 200 kms bike was disbalanced, as bikes front handle bends towards left and sometimes right and i had spent more two thousand for alinement to bike dealer,stills the come after 7 to 10 days.I had told to all friend to now not to buy royal enfield and consider some other brands, as i don't want to waste 2lks of money. Sorry to say i will soon sale this bike because it is generating medical issue at my shoulder and spine."
183,1,"RE bikes are great for the riders experience while buying otherwise its shit the same engine on every bike classic Thunderbird Electra just difference of price , so much of vibration after 60kmph sweet spot is 60 not beyond that very expensive service cost no Value for money proposition , no fuel gauge waste bike."
184,4,"I have planned to buy a yamaha r15, instead of that i purchase the classic 350, after i purchase the bike i felt very happy, i feel like very good and suitable bike for me. Comfort is very in good while riding, good mileage, design was very formal, decent and good look. I rode many bike but i never felt much comfortable than classic 350. I prefer the classic 350 if anybody interested to buy."
185,5,"top speed is 110 kmph. This bike has a more disadvantages but,Buyers love this bike.This has a Royal Look and Classical Feel.But,the services in some Dealers are very very Worse.But,otherwise bike is awesome.many Youngsters now a days love royal Enfield. very very comfortable for riders and pillion.Should fit Crash Guard.."
186,1,Servicing and maintenance Royal enfield 350 classic engine creating sound but service center engineer have no solution for my problem.I drive only 5000 km in 3 month but royal enfield service center engineer opens whole engine after that they are not solve the problem.Royal enfield sale defaulter bikes to customer.
187,1,"If anything that can let royal enfield down is its after sales service....The authorised service centres are leaving no stone unturned in forcing people to think twice before buying their most loveable dream bike....Because once they purchase this bike, the authorised service centres will make their life miserable and pockets empty. Being in a transferable job i have seen authorised service centres of five states, out of which, centres in up are really bad, but the worst are located at allahabad. I have bad experiences with both jaypee motors and vrindavan auto....People here are just sitting for looting people...Whatever problem you may have with your bike they will force ably do the servicing first, then change the engine and will do all jobs which have heavy replacement value involving huge sums of money with least amount of effort. They will never look for actual problem, but will always find ways and means to increase the bill. The best part is they will justify all their wrong doings and their is nobod"
188,5,"I love royal enfield and i'm fascinated by the quality, design, beating, torque, power that is offered by every royal enfield out there. As a matter of fact, there is no one who doesn't like enfield bikes these days. But, my love for royal enfield doesn't end there, it literally flew out of the clouds. It works so perfectly that there are no words to describe its loud sound and prodigious performance."
189,1,"I had a classic 350cc royal enfield which i already sold, very low pickup, can buy a r15 instead of wasting money on royal enfield. It looks like a 1970's bike. Looks like a duffer. No modern sports design, stupid oil tank just look like a fat person tummy. Engine sounds is too stupid, the sleeping dogs starts barking .. Fat body design just like a hyphopotenous. A guy passing behind you with a pulsar 220 or any other commuter or sports bike looks more smart. The pillion position seat same looking like a auto rickshaw front seat. Better royal should manufactured auto rickshaw rather than motorcycle. It suits it's company status like a auto rickshaw manufacturers. The fuck 350 cc engine is so slow that any one can overtake it with a 180cc pulsar or apache rtr. Every time when i sit at pillion seat of the bike, i feel i am sitting in front seat of rickshaw. Guys don't waste your money by purchasing royal enfield, it's not 1970's. Now 2018."
190,5,"I brought re classic 350 in year 2017 , & till date i have run it around 51000 km in three years , the machine is performing well & i personally bought it for long ride & tours . This is very fantastic machine."
191,5,"New re classic 350 riding quality is amazing and abs is working great while riding, i always think its have clear fuel gauge meter. Current fuel gauge can not identify that's how much fuel in tank. For average height rider have high low seating position adjustment in bike. And by the way classic is amazing riding quality. I am talking about new classic 350."
192,5,"I am using this model from more then one year. Basically i daily up down from office to home. It is an 80km journey daily. I love riding this bike because of it's stylish design, dug dug, speed and control. I also use this bike for my all field work.It is a powerful bike so we can believe on it at village road, digs, highway etc."
193,3,It's not very comfortable for tall people. Plus it has serious electrical issues. I am facing this problem in every 2 months . Worst bike.  While riding it's good . It runs smoothly . I have gone on many long trips but only problem i faced was electrical problem. Even the battery remains charged but it has some wiring issues.. The wire gets short many a times and engine never turns on .
194,5,"Fabulous cruiser, feels amazing when went for long drive out from the city, it's not good for a daily commute, but definitely stylist and gives read stance. If you are looking for daily ride purpose then don't buy this bike this not for those who rides daily for office etc. For show off and all its very good option."
195,5,Handling was good one The big issue is that tube tires it has maximum trouble Less braking Good for solo riders The big issue in royal Enfield is that tube tyres you can use solutions for that or you want to change alloys For first section kilometres we want to run bike in idle speed Clutch cable is big issue in this before trip you want to check it out.
196,5,"I bought this bike from kolkata just before the lockdown for my daily office journey. It's classic 350. Red in colour. It's giving really a royal feeling. Red and black combination is my favorite also. I bought this bike for it's killer look and royal feeling with a good performance. I modified my dream bike with extra 40k. Then, it's become more killer at its look."
197,2,Speed above 80 kmph the bike start vibrating a lot and its top speed is 107 kmph after full throttle at agra yamuna expressway. Servicing at their service centers are fraud and irrelevant charges are applied. There is very less distance between rear brakes and footrest peddle.Very poor rear brakes and on applying disc brakes the front tyre skits.
198,5,"Best of luck this bike purchase reality future bike and more than longer tripper , fantastic mind blowing.1. No back pane long trip2. Future this bike locking to realty.3. Every time 300 km wash your bike chain.4. Tyre size is smooth but quickly breaking speed.5. Mileage owner given public 35 km but every time not a given a mileage 35 km .. Km speed depends."
199,1,"Have bought bike in bangalore about 6 months back, daily i use bike to go to office.Below are the complaints i have so far.  1.One day bike didn't start, checked fuse condition but it was intact.Later service personnel came and started by correcting wire connection.  2.After a week of last incident started getting black smoke from silencer.It was very much disappointing one.  Finally i have decided to sell it.Royal enfield is not worth for its price."
200,1,"I have been with classic from last three years. I have driven 50k kms. So i am writing this with lot of experience. I will say no go call for classic, because of the maintenance cost. Every-time my servicing cost will be 3,500 to 5,000. Some times it crosses 5k. Car will be better to maintain instead of this. Mileage wise no issues. Think before you take classic 350. Every-time you will be end up with highly maintainable product. These days servicing centres are not caring due to more bikes."
201,2,"I was very excited while buying and was ready to wait 4 months for delivery but once i got the bike for 1 year the bike was running fine and i loved it but after 1 year passed it started giving problem with the engine, suspension and was very unreliable. Bike was more with mechanic than me. Not recommended at all"
202,5,Wonderful bike to ride has much more comfort To bike it you can also use this bike to any function in your family or to take a long drive in the himalayas like leh ladakh and in kashmir valley you will simply fell comfortably also after riding a bike 500 kms also has a heart look of a classic you will just love the bike.
203,1,"Very poor performance ,low quality ...No proper service ... Very much disappointed... After buying the new royal enfield 359cc bs4 ... Sound's like activa honda , it's totally very poor compare to old royal enfield ... Please think more .. Before you buy royal enfield bikes ... Very poor........."
204,4,"1. Because of the bs4 issue my bike delver got late, i waited more than month to get my royal enfield classic 350. Though that doesn't matter as i got updated version and technically improvise bike.  2. While riding its give you comfort sitting, royal feel and pride at the same time.  3. Re classic 350 is one of the most stylish from royal enfiled, very powerful engine.  4. Maintaining the classic 350 is bit high in cost because of powerful engine, metal and chrome body.  5. Cons are vibration, mileage."
205,4,Buying experience was good supportive staff royal enfield dhone automobiles kasarwadi. Riding experience i take my bike for daily commute comfort wise it's very nice fuel efficiency my classic 350 it's giving around 35/40 servicing and maintenance is easy not that difficult. Pros now it. Gets fuel reserve indicator cons still not twin trip meter.
206,5,It is a amazing vehicle i seen ever . It give royal look . High speed riding feel like flying. It is my dream vehicle . I love it so much . Service and maintenance is easy process . And cost is affordable. The riding experience is marvellous .  Speed is the main advantage in this bike.I didn't find any disadvantage in this bike.
207,5,Its was a fabulous bike i love it... But one thing is that u don't have fuel indicator..Maintenance and service r good too...For long distance travel its has a good mileage and runs very smooth without giving rest.I loved riding it. The shockers are too good as well....Riding this bike gives a bold look and its very hardy and easy to handle..
208,5,"It's awesome bike and very powerful engine that ride like fly feeling. The bikes pick up is very powerful, and the seat is like kings chair very comfortable Royal enfield was the superb bike and I love it. But the riding was so amazing for tours. So, go for classic 350 bike. The tyre and brake performance is superb."
209,5,"I owned a re classic in chestnut color. It was my favourite color. It's very comfortable for short or a long ride. Look's awesome, pocket friendly. Cons- there could be a fuel meter, it's available in 19 models. Vibration- finding vibration in 30-50 speed, but if i go 60 -90 speed very very less vibration i can feel."
210,5,"Royal enfield classic bullet is like a beast with full energy and strength. It give a different sensation to the rider. Who is riding the bike as well as who is sitting behind the rider. The sound of the bullet is just awesome making it the best. And it's look is amazing and i have in gun mettle gray color, about performance it's run like we are riding the bike on water because it's suspension is also very good and because i have a new one so it's mileage is also good right now it is giving me 39kmpl so it is good for me. And also service of royal enfield office that is also very good because when you will purchase a bike after some time they will also call you for the feedback how it is or how is your experience with this bike till now and this is the best bike for long route you can ride this bike without any stop till 300 km so this is the best part of it. From my point of view everyone should take a experience of this bike. It's really made like a gun"
211,4,"Perfectly suit for long ride . The performance and life of the bike are simply impressive .Massive in look. Loved by all age people for its classy look and easy to handle. The brake system which perfectly prefer to abs is a good choice. The bike will be sportive, occasional ride, trips, family etc. Which suits for all condition."
212,5,"This isn't a bike only its much more than that, its a feeling. I love dug dug its really a living heart sound and not Am the only royal enfield fan in my family my father and grand father also loved Bullet 350 and 500 and this classic 350 carrying the same dna of that attracts newer generations like me alot. Its reliable, rigid, tough and really made like a gun."
213,5,Good bike...Never had a serious problem with the bike..And ya....It really gives u royal feeling...Mileage maximum i got on highway is 52kmpl..But it varies a lot according to your riding(but never below 42kmpl).This bike is not for top speed.If u want speed then go for other bikes..Around 80-90ph it starts vibrating.But not much uncomfortable...And guys i don't think we go beyond 80kmph in cities...On highway also 70-80kmph is good and safe speed.Riding posture is good but you need to add some sponge in seat for more comfort if u do long rides like above 150kms or so(or your pelvic area will get numb) and for pillion add the back rest like tb as pillion seat is not comfortable for long rides.Overall if u do seating comfortable by adding cushioning(for long rides of more than 150kms only) its perfect bike. For city riding the bike is best. Easily controllable.
214,3,Pros 1. Excellent ride quality 2. Feel the power 3. Easy maintenance 4. Feel like king 5. Great pick up Not any bike below 3 lakhs can match this beast. Cons 1. Lots of vibration 2. Buying is headache 3. Shaking above 100km/hr 4. Self start is pathetic 5. Cheap quality parts But anyway i love my r.E. So much.
215,5,1-buying a royal enfield bike is bit tough process as it take 30-40 days to deliver the bike after order 2-there are no words for riding experience as the enfield is a pleasure rather than a bike 3-performance is very good but little slow pick up and it's classic look asked you buy it at it's first glance but there are some antique things in bike to be changed 4-servicing is affordable and there are n number of service centres across the country 5-pros:*awesome riding posture*comfortable seating*vintage feel*heavy torque*off road compatible Cons:*low power*absence of fuel gauge*poor safety features
216,5,Good bike for long ride and safe ride and i wish one day i ride with bike form my house to leh-ladakh with my friend the bike sound is very good and bike weight is also good so bike is good for highway and long ride and the bike is good class and we want the any how and engine is good i love this bike
217,3,my dream bike classic 350 i got it.but riding experience very worst i feel it. really looks is awesome performance 80 klm speed is better.more than noise problem I'm disappointed.service experience very bad. first 400 kilometer reached clutch plate damaged not moved bike.not claimed bike charge.gear shifting problem.automatic 1st geared moved bike. i am really i thought irritating service experience very very bad.
218,1,Service station not good.Riding experience very bad when attended 100 kph i feel more vibration .I am disappointed with pillion seat which is not comfortable leg is paining after you reach 50 km .Braking is not bad but after 500km you need to retain brake or tight .When u start the engine often terrible sound arise or come so on
219,5,I was founding some powerful bike under 350 cc segment then i found royal enfield 350 classic which has bold look and whole metal design. Riding experience is like royal people. Bold look feels heavy and good performance as 350 cc bike segment. Less maintenance or maintenance free bike. Service quality of this bike is good Pros.. Easy to control on road. Cons.. Heavy.
220,5,It is very hard and branded bike everyone know. I have won this bike upto 6 months it is very good bike of all time. I have riding this bike everyday at every occasion. The riding position is very good it's comfortable relaxing and reliable. I have installed dolphin exhaust for best loud sound. I have owned classic 350 gunmetal gray..It was look unique and be royal.This bikes maintenance low and charges higher but effortable.In highway for best riding experience.. And offroad riding is so smooth and comfortable.. This bikes disadvantages is its weight in traffic i face many troubles and parking place.. Bt its a awesome bike at this price range.
221,3,"Worst buying experience  Riding experience is not so great  No fuel meter is a setback  Worst services  If you park your bike in rain it won't start because of poor built quality overall i'm not satisfied with the bike chain sprocket is also worst better go for some other bike. Not worth for money, waiting period is also high"
222,5,"1. Buying experience was average and could be more improved. Royal enfield server is generally always down and i waited 2 hours to collect all the documents but this need to be improved for better buying experience 2. Riding experience is good as so far i have driven around 500km and have to go for the first service. But during last one month mine side stand sensor stopped working. Other things are fine and i am getting around 30-32 kmpl mileage, though using the shell petrol. I will give some more update after 1st service 3. Looks are awesome and performance is good for a smooth ride or around 60-70km.. I didn't drive more than 60 considering new machine.4. Will update after the first service done5. Pros: good looks, comfortable ride , very easy to handle while driving. Cons: poor electronics but royal enfield is not meant for that.."
223,3,"I got mad about these bullet family so i choose classic 350. But it’s a lot of complaints my money was loose many many problem . Looks and performance are good. Riding experience good. Service and maintenance are too coast. Classic is useful for citizens . I am a youngster so so my vision about classic is so bad but royal enifiled himalayan , gt interceptor is ok for us."
224,5,"The royal enfield classic 350 is the perfect motorcycle for a beginner or for anyone wanting to get back on a bike after many years of driving.At only 412 pounds, it is an easy motorcycle to grab hold of, easy to sit on, easy to operate and there’s not nearly enough horsepower to get you in any trouble. It’s the perfect conveyance for all those “rides of gentlemen” where everybody wears vests, mustache wax and monocles. It is comfortable and as high pickup but maintenance is some what costly remaining it is completely perfect."
225,5,"I was no heading before i had royal enfield classic . I had first driven this bike really i feel awesome and feel like royal . Now i had ride 2500 kms my bike its overall feedback is so good to my knowledge , i would like to recommend all of you if your budget is more than 1.5 Lakh then you should purchase this royal enfield classic 350 ."
226,4,"Classic 350 is a intimate motor for bike lovers. It is noteworthy for revealing classic insights of my moments with the bike. The bike classic have a chronicling experience which have transformed it to a notable and trustworthy bike in hearts of Indians. While describing the riding moments, one get impression of ecstasy driving. I have taken a complete research in buying a motor. Bullet had satisfied my right decision to choose it. Looks and performances are wonderful but hoping new innovation as those in premium bikes. Although the bike provides much stability service and maintenance are quite high as compared to other bikes. The quality of bike does not permit one to any negative comments. Bullet is deeply personal bike with its soul and substance. It inspires to take plunge despite all obstacles and to 'be liberal in our riding moments'Everything does not provide quality but bullet provides quality. It is like a gun and moves like a bullet."
227,5,I love this bike so much.This bike is comfortable.When i saw him first time i desperately wanted this bike.This bike has a good riding experience with me.This is the best bike.This bike has its own look which makes it perfect bike.This bike has a good maintaining of sevicing. I preferred to use the royal enfield bike because it is the one of the best bike.
228,5,This is an amazing bike which has an super powered engine which i was owned from last 1 yr this is very good and condition of this vehicle i maintain perfectly really awesome bike this was i have ever seen in India and i am very lucky about using this vehicle this bike made me feel very royal and very comfortable.
229,5,"It's an amazing bike for normal users...Not harsh riders, this is a cruise bike and it can go on a cruise speed of 80 at ease,and using it till 2015 has given a good experience...There were some complaints made by myself on some stupid movements...After all this bike is an excellent choice for a cruise rider,and i am damn sure riding this bike is really comfortable and there are no body pain in riding this bike for too long..And i am happy for buying this."
230,5,"I learnt to ride on an old bullet 350 with a right side gearshift and neutral box! and i found it incredibly hard at first. Then my dad bought a honda unicorn (which is quite heavy for a 150cc bike) and i loved the riding experience on it.A couple of years later i bought a thunderbird 350cc and i found it even easier to ride than the unicorn. The bike is quite heavy but the centre of gravity is much lower and hence it is easier to handle. In terms of braking, it has a dual-disc brake system which has not failed me yet since 2016. The only issue i have faced is vibrations when you cross 100kmph of the highways…wear good leather gloves, and that is dealt with easily."
231,4,"Didn’t get the desired colour and takes much time for delivery. Riding is good, Looks are brilliant, Performance is good. Service and maintenance is not bad. Build quality is not so good. I got the 350 signals model the silencer got rusted and paint is also removing(black). Silencer doesn’t sound good And it’s little expensive."
232,5,I bought it on 10th june 2018 it's a muscle bullet with max torque and power carry 346cc this ride is very powerful it's performance is better if you don't change silencer and other spare parts of bullet..... Service is awesome they do service in 90min there are not a single cons in this muscle pros are 1. Max power 2. Max torque 3. Best mileage 4. Very comfortable 5. Best for long cruise..... Max speed is 129km/h.
233,5,1 i had bought the bike with out gst at low when compared to now. It is worthy for our money. Excellent bike  2 very comfortable i am loving it  3 stylish and mind blowing a king only can ride a re the feeling i had got  4 superb and excellent response to the service center itself now also  5 very good. Awesome
234,5,"Royal enfield is always been in my wish list . I really feel very proud in riding this bike . I feel like a superhero whenever i ride it. Easy to handle .This is a dream bike for me . Highlights: low cost , maintenance, powerful engine , unique look , easy to handle , i would really love to have it in my collection."
235,5,"I have bought bike in 2015 , waiting period was 6 months , at that time it was in very demand but i got bike after 8 months after booking & riding experience is very good if we use gold star exhaust the pick-up is very good & even top speed also increases but the mileage decrease . My bike mileage decreased to 33kmpl from 40kmpl Look of bike i very good if you maintain it properly. Servicing is not much high...Built quality is very good ....Once I met with accident not even a dent."
236,4,"For us guys who have the passion of riding bikes. All that comes to our mind are bikes manufactured by big companies like harley davidson, kawasaki, ducati and much more. But all of us are not fortunate enough to ride those big names. So we stick to our budget for the best available options. Royal enfield did not disappoint when it comes to budget for a dream of riders passion. Well performing bikes for affordable values. Classic 350 has a good mileage for a 350cc bike as well as satisfy the overall riding experience for people who look to ride for freedom and joy. And yes, sometimes even when you thirst for adrenaline it gives you speedy riding experience too. I would love to recommend royal enfield classic 350 for people like me who don't have the budget for a big bikes.. Its worth every penny.. Ride till i die.. Peace out."
237,3,My buying experience was good but there are certain things that needs to be worked out by royal enfield in terms of keeping a check on their dealers for eg when i purchased my bike the dealer insisted that we have to buy the helmet with the bike as is it mandatory. Frankly this makes no sense if one already has a helmet why will he buy another.  Pros: though it is a heavy bike you don't feel the weight when riding.  Mileage is also good  You don't feel the engine heat  Cons: poor braking  Poor material quality
238,5,I found the bullet classic 350 very awesome..It was great experience taking the test ride...Looks are very impressive..Servicing and maintenance..Are too good.I would suggest it to others also ..Its looks are killer. .It feels as if a king taking a ride on a beast...It sounds like a roaring lion .....
239,4,A bike that is brought with your heart not with your mind at a price where bikes come with the all the elections upholstery on the platter this beast socks to the basics  once you start the bike the thump and the vibrations welcome you with open arms. Start cruising and the bike feels at home 70 to 90kmph is a sweet spot for the bike but exceed the 110 kmph mark and you know that is out of its element . This classic thomper isn't meant to record 0-60 kmph times or raging the highways with a zap.  But yeah the vibrations when they creep to t handle arms it makes the rear view mirror it makes it almost impossible to see what's behind you .  So all in all its a bike to buy with your heart and the list of cons so here they are  1. The lack of a fuel gauge  2. No abs even though the high price of the bike  3. The vibrations that make r ear visibility almost impossible  4. A little refinement will do wonders on those long highways  so here's the review of my classic 350 and its a beast that is practical too in a s
240,3,"I bought this bike 2011 when it had a waiting period of 6+ months in bangalore. So, i bought it from my home town kharagpur, west bengal & transported. Then from bangalore to delhi and delhi to my home town i had journey with this bull almost a decade. Very good for long journey, not for daily commute. Also need periodic maintenance to alive this. Service cost is bit high. Vibration is there on 100+.But on a long highway while it actually burnt and other bikes are exhausted this ride will feel like a feather and runs infinite."
241,5,best two wheeler with best pickup on highway it goes up to 120km/h without any difficulty and can go up to 140km/hr. This bike is not suitable for a person with weak structure because the pull in 2nd gear towards backward is marvelous but unfortunately service center are disappointing and charges money without service.
242,5,"don't you ever call it a bike to the person who owns one! it is not a bike, it is addiction and passion. This beast is actually a feast for a rider. They say once you ride a bullet, you will never ride any other bike. Bullet is one of the productions India is proud of and exports to other countries across the globe. Thank you royal enfield"
243,5,"Yes one of most buying bike(beast) in India .With outstanding looks & engine ,it is a dream of many people in India to buy bullet and went to a tour of ladakh with our best friend or with our sole-mates .It is my dream also to have one of the bullet ( beast) & went to a tour with my best friend i will personally rate 110 from 100."
244,3,"Buying experience was great and riding experience is the best biking experience ever its the best bike for long route riders. The looks are old is gold type looks and yes its excellent, the only thing which is not so good is the maintenance cost it took 4-6 thousand rupees for a servicing after every 2-3 months gap if you ride only in the city then also if u kept it covered for a month then also, now you think how much it will cost after you ride for a long ride. It's excellent bike performance mileage and all but the only problem is the maintenance and servicing issue if you're ok with that go for it its the best. Thank you"
245,5,"The beast..! I love to ride this bike..!  We don't get bored riding this bike even for long hours..! It is the best bike which can be used for a long drive..! Every other bike should clear the way when a enfield moves on..!No bike can stand within this beast..!  Its power,its performance,its look.., Everything is just awesome..!"
246,5,"My royal enfield so good, i love my bike, its performance is so good, i have maintaining it from 6 months, i loved that bike i have red colour bike and i have modified it the best thing i love is the sound in it."
247,4,Royal enfield not give good average .It consume large amount of petrol than other bikes .Royal enfield also good for long tour like some riders use for leh trip or shimla trip.It is also good because it have good grip of tyres .Royal enfield look royal on people who have beard and good height and personality.
248,5,It is very nice to ride for long distance no any back pain and no any other problems. Gunmetal colour is looks so good.Compared to some other bikes like java and something it is too good and noise can be filtered.We can drive it for 60 to 80 gives good mileage also and upto 40kmpl price must be also normal
249,5,Royal enfield classic 350 is a royal and amazing bike. According to my experience its worthy in price. I am giving always priority to classic 350 among all the bikes. I am suggesting my all of the friends to go to royal enfield classic 350 ride once and experience a great journey.
250,5,"Buying was much easy and service was satisfying with available nearby maintenance centres. Riding on it is so amazing in every road whether highways or rural and gives an pure trendy and royal look .It's performance is undoubtedly thrilling and very good.It's looks royal and classical and service is much easier and rapid. It's an all-rounder bike for every moment of your life in ceremony,party and daily work. It's awesome......."
251,5,It's waiting period of 6 to 7 months. But it's ok for royal enfield i can wait for .The day when i got this bull i was really feeling the king of the road. And the next day i went to daman ride with my wife.She got no idea regarding bikes but she reply me that it's like a machine. Maintenance also not so high as compare to other company higher cc bikes.
252,4,Actually the one thing i hate in my bike is that the gears are to be tapped/shifted twice or else the bike gives a jerk.There is no fuel indicator in my model. The bike's keyhole has a nut in it's surrounding and that will be loose after few days.It has a good braking system and if overused you may fall.Amazing bike for respect expectorant..But anyways i love my bike.........
253,4,"It is good in comfort and riding position.Only this bike has only one problem that the engine gets cool down easily.This bike is not going with tubeless option in its wheel.What if if you are going to some important work and then it got punctured,due to its heavy weight you can't walk also with this bike for 1km by pushing it."
254,3,"Well the buying experience with this bike was very good just like almost all the other brands. The staff is very good at the dealership that I bought the bike. The servicing is on the expensive side but it's worth it. They service it very well. The only positive about this bike is the looks. The riding position is very comfortable but the overall ride isn't. Especially the vibrations that are felt everywhere. And the pillion seat is the worst. If the ride is more than 15kms don't even think about taking a pillion as the amount of vibrations on the pillion seat are more than enough to make your body go numb. The engine has quite good amount of torque but lacks in terms of power and top speed. Cruising Speed of this bike is 60kmph. More than that and be ready for numb hands. The handling is very bad, as in maneuverability is bad. Heavy bike for traffic. Mileage is not more than 45kmpl that too if you ride it sanely. And during monsoon rusting is the biggest problem. I did once get stranded because the electric"
255,4,I ride this legendary bullet its was fell like i am trip on any type of air craft its sound like that helicopter and its was good posture to ride this amazing its best for long ride but its have a some common terms mistake who people buy royal enfield 1.5k to 1.9 k spend its dint get fuel indication on royal enfield classic 350 so its good but on those amount atleast royal enfield give fuel meter its humble request for re company.
256,5,"Buying experience is very good i did not face any difficulty to buy bike and ridding experience is awesome his when you ride this than you feel it how bike is about the performance and look, you can also see the look of bike look is very good in cruise bike and service and performances; this is good there many service centre of royal enfield and service cost is low and lots of thing are there to say."
257,4,"Buying experience is good, ride a bike as you love yourself that can be maintained your riding standard, people look and said wow what a bike that because how you maintain as a handsome bike for a future performance you can servicing after 5000km and every month you'll check your bike mobil, colin water, brake oil etc."
258,5,Its only enfield that makes me feel proud while riding my enfield rather than riding any other bike..Its comfortable for me in any situation..I experienced great performance since last 3 years..I recommend all the viewers to try this bike out on the road...Coz it have quite less maintenance than other 350cc bikes.
259,5,"1.It was too good. My dream bike now is with me after 5 yrs. Emotions are attached with her 2.Feel good with every ride from bottom of the 3.She is very beautiful, very good performance 4.Servicing experience is good. No much more maintenance while regular service 5.Pros.It has powerful engine Cons.Fuel gauge."
260,5,M a madly into royal enfield.. Specially your military colour.. As the part of force member.. We already having royal enfield in our campus.. So whenever i need to travel in border area i always prefer royal enfield instead of our maruti gypsy.. As you already border roads are rarely maintained and some of our border out post is in heel area.. So normally bike needs power and comfort.. And all these qualities given by royal enfield classic with their Hercules look.. As we having already a branch of vehicles so servicing and maintenance is not an issue.. Now i am planning to buy same bike for myself so that whenever i will go to leave.. I will ride my own #royalenfieldclassic350.
261,5,"It's really awesome bike and good for those are looking for passion. Adventures bike. Good to buy. Feeling good after buy. Mileage is good. Good self, Good tyre, Good headlight, Hunk bike. Feeling good. Recommended to my friends to buy. Again planning to buy for by brother. Heavy weight while riding very smooth. Does not matter you are taller or shorter."
262,2,Maintenance cost is very high basically some parts are very weak they need to replace in every 10000km running like self bearing and chain sprocket handle racer. It required to service within running of 2500km. As you rise the speed more than 80 km the bike start vibrate and fuel consumption is about.
263,4,Fantastic bike to ride and it has glamour of looking different from other bikes. When you ride this bike you feeling of king will come as in it name already there royal that feeling will come. I have brought my bike last year and it has been 1 year i m enjoying riding it nothing has happen to it....
264,5,"when I bought classic 350 bs6 model is very good it is best bike for tours the sound is very good I bought red colour the riding style is very good performance is super my opinion is good bike so you can buy this bike, when you ride bullet you will feel like a bullet rider, bullet is an style bike and wonderful bike."
265,5,"I bought royal enfield classic-350 after overall wait of 1 month from the booking date. Mine one year ownership is awesome only with slight general repairs. When my odo turned 15,000km i got my service billing amount around ?6,000 that’s the only thing i felt bad! except the maintenance charges bike is awesome!  Handle moment and vibration must be manage a lit more"
266,5,This bike was my childhood crush when i finally got it that was the best feeling .... :).. I am in love with it no matter what. Long rides or small make me feel comfortable .. Riding it makes me feel awesome...:) this bike is recommended . Love for royal enfield deep inside my heart...:)
267,5,It is very comfortable ...You can use it for long journey but don't think it is sporty But it will give you more comfort. I have bought it 2 yr before everything is ok only sometimes i feel top seed should be increased.At the service center there are trained staff you will not face any problem Maintenance of bike is little bit high but not as much so that you cant afford.
268,5,It is awesome bike in look. Mileage is very good about 33-37 km per liter.When u ride its feels like u r king of road.Balance of bike is very good. It has good power on sloppy road. Look is fantastic.Also there are many accessories available in market to change the look of your bike. Lights and alloy wheels and many more. Over all is very good. It has mettle body.
269,5,"Not yet bought but planing for that.....Riding is amazing feeling like royal.... Looks stunning, beauty , amaze, 10 out of 10 on looks...Performance is remarkable without any doubt..... Service is amazing and maintains is affordable....Eager to buy in very short period...Any how...I am dr. by profession but not hesitate to drive royal without any doubt..."
270,5,The bike is just amazing. As it runs smoothly and so far there isn't any problem. Since i have bought a couple of vehicles throughout past few years this has been the best. The bike is comfortable and the road grip of the bike is fabulous. Maintenance ans service is average if you maintain and drive the bike in proper manner.
271,4,It is good bike for daily commuting in city. The mileage of the bike is decent. It is not that much comfortable so not for the one who wants to use it for long rides. Vibrations is the major cons of royal enfield bikes. The maintenance cost is also higher compare to other bikes of same class. It fetch you that value for money as u expect.
272,5,"Hi friends, my one friend has this bike i once drove this bike i felt so happy and i was just feeling very happy and confused that it was a bike or a cloud It was just gorgeous and i felt that i cannot control my self a some tears also came I was a royal enfield user before 20 years but these years i was riding different bikes And re has refined its engine also."
273,4,1 ) royal enfield classic 350 you will get a very best experience and many varieties of colours. 2) my personal riding experience is awesome the brakes are good enough with gripped tyres. 3) performance is very good.4) you have to do maintenance and care a lot. 5)if you are a bullet lover then buy now.
274,5,One of the best bike i have ever bought riding it from past 2 year and don't have much problem . I just do regular service at 3000 kms and fill fuel nothing else no problem or any huge maintenance costs just buy it no problem but only if you can take care if this beast and i easily gets mileage of 35-40 in city which is good enough.
275,5,Awesome experience..Best bike yet..and love it...Smooth riding..Smooth performance..And mileage is superb according to heavy engine and comfort is awesome overall it is the best bike for youth and don't be confuse within choices of royal enfield and others bike..Always go for royal enfield..And am sure you love it.
276,5,"It was a great experience by riding royal enfield bullet classic 350. I used to ride occasionally but the experience was good, one can buy royal enfield for their pleasure rides. There are many vibrant colours available and every colour has its different image...I loved all colours so go and ride this lovely royal enfield.Thank you."
277,5,Royal enfield such a massive bike going on enfield is not just a fun but a royalty like its name enfield.  I am using classic 350 the fuel efficiency of my bike is awesome. So suggest everyone to pick this up.  I am so proud to be the owner of an enfield which is a brand since earlier time. So feel the royal on enfield.
278,5,One of dream bike when i ride it i feel that separate pride love my re. It was a big dream to me to buy a re after i buy i can’t believe that i have also got such a awesome bike it’s not just a bike it’s my partner which saves my time i just love it before buying it i used to see everyone who rides re in road i keep on seeing till that bike goes but now i have my own re i can’t believe it thank you.
279,5,1. Good buying experience and good seller 2. Riding experience is excellent because the bike stick on road and carry forward and don't fell the bick is heavy3. Looks and performance vije i lover of this bike this bike is my second love4.This bike bike maintenance and service i don't know because my bike 1 st service is tomorrow 5. I don't know pros and cons yet.
280,5,"Looking like a rajput bike and actually felling the riding of bike. Easy maintenance with no huge amount of servicing charge. Very comfortable in riding the bike.  i am always prefer bullet.  I am always advice to purchase the royal enfield to my friends ,relatives and other also.  One thing if their will be the digital meter ,then its good."
281,5,Buying experience is very good. Riding experience also is very good because it is to fide and pavillion are easy to long route seat.Mileage is low but its ok because i am a bullet lover but its disappointment to tubeless tyre is not giving to customer its tube tyre. Service and maintenance is good. Good look.
282,5,This is a cool bike in case of looks already but the drag in it is low as it have a 350cc engine.This bike is very good for touring and road trip but in traffic this is not a bike you should rely on. Every year same components with new colours are available.This bike is make of good product that's good but optimisation is important.
283,5,"Good braking system and good pick up for highway rides and also good mileage at highway rides, in city also it was satisfied, it have a good horse power and gearing system also very perfect it was an awesome bike that i have used showroom service also very satisfied when it was moving feels like an awesome ride that we have"
284,4,"Good ride. The problems that I had to face is, the parking lights/ eyes, stopped working just after 3-4 months if purchase. The oxygen sensor also got a bit rusty. Bought this ride as it was like a dream for me.. just like anyone else. All I can say is, you will definitely get some better bikes in this given range.. but if you are into old school stuff and obsessed with RE you should go for it. However, there are many better options in this range. PS- apart from issues with the bike the main issue is (out here in kolkata) the staff.. the people from service center are a bit weird. But no matter what, at the end of the day, I am one of those typical guys who grew up watching this tough old beast. So am still happy anyway."
285,5,Best bike compared to mileage and best for daily commuter best royal enfield bike and very affordable and the bike best balancing compared to other similar segment bikes but it is very fun the seating and riding position is the best in my opinion the speed upto 80 kmperhr is ok but above 80 it has lots of vibration.
286,3,"If you are a type of twisting throttles ,racing with other fellow riders ,cornering lover and all don't choose the classic 350 . The bike vibrates a lot above 90km/hr..If you are a guy of pleasant riding experiences ,long cool rides you can choose this one ..The braking is also not perfect climbing a hill and all you will know the power of classic 350 but i will tell you again won't feel good to youngsters who loves cornering and all.. Otherwise for peaceful riding the classic is good"
287,5,"I was so much excited that time when i went showroom with my dad to buy this freaking awesome bike And the moment when i was coming home with my new bike is really beautiful and unforgettable that day it was raining heavily 29 Sept. Its look is enough to steal the hearts of Yeah, its maintenance charges are little bit high as comparability others but its riding experience is far better. The pros are its such a hunk that could boost one's personality, Sorry no cons as of now, i love it so much."
288,3,"The dealer did a good part in giving timely delivery. For daily commute it is awesome on city roads can be manoeuvred easily, has good cornering ability in spite of its weight and you don't feel tired at all. Fuel efficiency is also fairly good. I get 35 - 40. Coming to speed part, the sweet spot is 65-70kmph. At 80 you will feel slight vibrations which are manageable. At 85 plus The vibrations become significant and it is not safe to ride this bike at above 80 except on straight highways. I have clocked 110kmph when i rode with the wind and the vibrations were so intense that even a minor bump on road would have thrown me off. Braking is another dangerous aspect about this bike . On one occasion i had to brake hard at about 65kmph and 5th gear , first rear and after a fraction of a second, front brake too. The bike skidded and fell to the right. I was lucky to wear a thick jeans that day which saved my leg from burning under the silencer as the leg was stuck under it for more than a second.You have to get h"
289,5,"So easy to buy It's available on emi Riding a bullet is like riding your passion, you will feel like a king.Beast look, smooth working.Less maintenance and strong enough for the bad roads.Comfortable and ultimate balance.I will recommend those who love riding bikes, for their pleasure... Royal enfield makes you royal."
290,5,"Ultimate bike, i just love royal enfield specially the voice, the power of this bike, balancing everything , i have travelled a lot on this bike, we have a gang of 9 friends all of them have royal enfield classic 350, we all go around on weekend for a long drive with complete safety like helmet guards etc"
291,5,"I went many long drive with my friends And we just enjoyed ridding royal ... It was a good choice of me and am satisfied with it full of my heart. Its a different feeling Everything different Its hard to explain of No other bike gives such feelings , i had gone with my wife and she too felt lot comfortable and more good than other bikes."
292,5,I like ride with my love means my royal enfield because this is very nice perform in all side. I love my angel.Bullet bike suspension is more like it.And this bike is mostly people use in long drive because it it give a nice performance in hills and any roads that is good for any other bikes.So i am advise all riders take a royal enfield and enjoy your long drive save memorable points.
293,5,I'm in love with this bike from the very first day when i bought this. While riding it just feel like a superstar. Good handling with good comfort on riding. Looks is awesome. Servicing from company authorized dealer only. After servicing it will like you are flying. Till today no problem with bike. Just buy it and you will feel like a king of road.
294,5,"It was my childhood dream to own a royal enfield and i have make it true. Earlier it was not but now its easy to get the bike delivered quickly. When you think a royal enfield it means that you don't think of speed and updated technology, what you think is the dug-dug. The colour variations and look in present day are just dope.Servicing of the bike is easy as most of the shops know it.My enfield gives the mileage of 40. The speed is enough for me but sometimes on highway or speedrun it feels a little low when it comes to get more faster. The only problem is that its increasing popularity and reach of people is leading in blunders modifications and also the poor exhaust and their pathakas. I think a classic should be kept as classic as it can. Overall i must suggest you the bike if you are touring lover, a vintage lover rider or a old school lover."
295,2,"Bs4 is really bad compared to bs4  Self start is not working properly , so many noises while driving, mileage also bad 29 kmpl in city , 34 in outer , kick start is ok , bs3 is better i think , my brother owned bs3 good to drive and maintain is easy  Always remember to check the battery box. All re bikes key is working in any bike battery box , always check that"
296,5,Awesome riding experience i love to take long drives on royal enfield. It looks great it's like a machine gun. The most love is the comfort and royalty when riding bike. The sound of bullet is like a machine gun.One suggestion to royal enfield please try to provide a good sounds silencer with bike .
297,5,Comfortable bike and right to rajputana 1 very helpful customer service 2 a smooth riding and riding 3 looking for singam performance is very good excellent fabulous superb unbelievable 4 sweet talking dealer very good service in service provider and low maintenance engine performance is very good and fast fasted bike in the world 5 number 1 bike kings of the bike segment royal enfield.
298,5,I had bought the bike around 3 years ago the bike is literally the best .... When u ride the bike u will enjoy it feels so comfortable riding it. Looks though no comparison with any other vehicle that metallic look it's strong ... Servicing and maintenance is also good there r lots of service centers available. It's very suitable for long drives and there won't be any difficulty in driving it . I prefer everyone to buy that if they want to buy a good vehicle....
299,5,"I have use the royal enfield classic 350cc,it is actually amazing. What is so special is the feel, u get the feel of royalty. Its really cool bike. Including over performances, price, mileage and etc. Its really good and i advice the viewers to use it once and then you'll get to know it well.Even the maintenance cost is also affordable... Over all performance an is great.."
300,5,"Wonderful look...Best experience for long distance riding....... This bike is best adventure bike in under 200000 rupees.....Royal enfield is low cost maintenance bike because , one time servicing in a year, servicing cost are under budget , i mean low servicing cost. Bullet just not a bike is a machine."
301,4,"Only delivering takes time, But patience is the key. Royal enfield has been great all the time. Feels so good to ride. We all know it was made like a gun and that's true. It's almost been a year, no repairs so far and serviced thrice however it is hard to push when bike is out of fuel or doesn't start."
302,4,Royal enfield classic 350 is a affordable cruising bike with a great mileage of approximately 35 to 40 kmpl. Classic is a very well customization bike good for touring. With pillion removed this bike looks like a bobber which is quite stunning. cons is basically its maintenance should be quite often. Due to its vibration some nuts may loosen which needs to be checked and serviced time to time.
303,5,This is a superb bike for me . My experience with classic 350 is awesome. This is my dream bike so i purchase that . Classic 350 is always with me on every ride. It has low maintenance. If i want to talk about its looks so i have no word s to say about this . Looks and performance of this bike is superior quality and awesome.
304,4,"I was being passionate of buying my own beast and for that, the well known beast is #royalenfield#classic#350 that i owned  It gives you a awesome ride and a royal look to yourself, yeah this beast is also comfy and nice to ride. Yep this one is heavy to .However maintaining this bike or any of the other bikes is depending on your passion on it and this needs a certain extra watch on it. But by servicing it could be a superb one . This one is a bit heavy so on the ride feels you a great look pickup wise is good for this beast, long rides are mostly loved and suited for this. However this one #royalenfield#classic#350 is made for luxurious ride and maintaining it will give a nice and comfy ride....!!"
305,5,"Amazing bike, just like dream come true i love the ride every day any time this bike is world no 1 bike so please go on grab it as soon as possible bike sound is amazing. It run very smoothly on road. For long trips it so comfortable and and give feels like royal so why are waiting go and check out fast Knocking of this bike is like you are in helicopter."

It's a very good experience and you found it that this is the best way of achieving this bike as soon as possible because i am a very passionate about bikes ..."
307,4,The perfect riding companion for a every rider.For every trip it may pong or short its good enough than any other likes in market.  Its feel like raiding a bull... Everyone looks at you when raiding through roads.. Sound is like big story comes following.. And its look also great to attract everyone
308,5,"When i was buying this bike the cost was 1,76,000 and it is bs-4 engine.When we are going to any long drive there will be no pains nothing the journey will be very smooth.The looks and finishing of bike is excellent while coming to the performance there will be no complaint about bike. Their servicing cost will be after 4th service 1600 and maintenance is depends on us.The mileage is 36 kmpl in local when i am going to long drives it is giving 46 kmpl. Pros:1)extraordinary look 2)comfort driving."
309,5,It should very comfort to long journey And oil change offer 2500-3000 km. It is electric starter very easy to starting the bike. Rim wheel is looking very nice. It easy very difficult to kick starting And it servicing charge. Is expansive and it is average 40 to 45 km. It very looking bike. Its speed is very high.
310,5,"I love royal enfield. My most favourite bike is royal.I also have a gun metal gray. When i riding on my bike feel like god.This is my dream bike.And i love the royal enfield showroom.And there service. All employees are very nice and good.When training in this bike,you feel a great moment.I love this."
311,4,I use enfilade 350 classic. It's a amazing looking bike and strong than others. It gives 35 km mileage . When i ride it on 110 km / h it's not vibrate but other bikes vibrates . It's a good bike for long tour . I think 350 is good than 500 cc because 350 gives better mileage .All enfilade user feel proud because they use enfield. I am so proud . It's not a bike it's a tiger
312,4,Its very good to visit the show room....Riding is very comfortable...Its looks like a race bike so its very beautiful things when i was riding in that bike....Service is good...Maintenance is little costly.....When we are in a ride..Its looks like a racing...So its very grateful to drive this......
313,4,"This motorcycle is unique in its own way. The only drawback is the power which seems quite low considering the engine specs but that's not a problem because there are many other factors like torque,comfort,ride quality, use of metal almost everywhere and the legendary thump which makes the classic 350 an amazing motorcycle."
314,5,"Am a great fan of royal enfield. Whenever i ride this gun, will feel a wonderful experience. Comfort ability is one of the main aspect. Possibility of accident is too less as comparing to other bikes.But maintenance is one of the issue that most of the peoples are facing nowadays. Anyway my rating is 5 out of 5."
315,3,"The pros: Bike is quite sturdy. Loads of torque. Dual disk break works well. Macho feels. You can seat with youur parents unlike other bike such as dominar or ktm. Cons: Doesn't have fuel gauge, new one has i guess.Max speed you can go is 90 post which it vibes a lot. So cruise at 80-90 on highway.Opinion - if you ride fast n have gang of friend who have other bike you can't keep up with them."
316,5,"Ohhhh...... What a bike......... Sorry its not just a bike, it gives something special that ordinary bike cant give!!!thanking bikewale for getting more information about re.It gives me enough confidence on road. It enable us to feel a bike while riding this extra ordinary machine. Big salute for re."
317,5,Since childhood i have a dream to drive royal enfield my dream comes true i recommend all of my friends to buy this. Because it's not bike it's jet fighter lots love.. When my friends decide to tour i use my bullet it's awesomeness overloaded last year i have ladakh tour with my friends we use royal enfield i feel my dream comes true... Love you royal enfield.
318,5,"The buying experience is very good. Riding experience is like a heaven. Look is very sexy and cool. Servicing and maintenance is good. Oil change after you ride 3000 and maintain your bike performance. It is a rocket which launch in roads so sexy look, it's give you a unique personality and look when you ride this."
319,5,I bought this bike this year only from their official showroom. I had to wait for 2 days as this bike is in high demand. But it was totally worth it. Riding it feels like i am the king of roads. The feeling is incomparable. The front dial gives you raajgaddi type experience and it is really comfortable too. Rest 350cc is more than enough for Indian city roads and i never felt even a bit of problem taking it hilly areas too. I say go for this bike if you have a passion for vintage plus bold and strong things. And obviously swag comes along.
320,5,Classic 350 is not the bike who will take speed of 100kmph in just 5 second it keeps you safe.You will experience a amazing riding with with royal touch..It's not the expansive than its feeling.Very suitable for long drive and..Now the self start feature is very useful.This is not a bike this is a member of my family .It is a very good bike with good riding comfort .
321,5,"I purchased royal enfield 350 cc classic in 2018 & used now my memorable experiences.Good bike...Never had a serious problem with the bike..And ya....It really gives u royal feeling...Mileage maximum i got on highway is 52kmpl..But it varies a lot according to your riding(but never below 42kmpl).Performance isn’t as fascinating as one would expect from a bike belonging to re clan. Unfortunately, the 350cc engine lacks punch and the hefty weight plays against it restricting bike’s ride quality. Thunderbird 350 shows signs of discomfort when cruised above 90 kmph. As per royal enfield’s word, thunderbird 350 can deliver 23 kmpl of fuel economy which is way too less as compared to competitors in the segment. Everything is best."
322,5,Its a best bike and comfortable  It has a good suspension.  It gives us a best experience of riding the bike.  If you want to buy a classic 350 its your best decision as it is a different and heavy as compared to other bikes  And if you want to feel how the riders feel you must buy this bike.You will never feel guilty by purchasing this bike.
323,5,Royal enfield classic gun metal grey is the top most rated and it looks very stylish and must use company silencer for better mileage and use tubeless tyres for long rides and fill nitrogen air only.Must and should use helmet and double seat for more comfort.Regular servicing is required at-least once per month.
324,5,M a madly into royal enfield.. Specially your military colour.. As the part of force member.. We already having royal enfield in our campus.. So whenever i need to travel in border area i always prefer royal enfield instead of our maruti gypsy.. As you already border roads are rarely maintained and some of our border out post is in heel area.. So normally bike needs power and comfort.. And all these qualities given by royal enfield classic with their hercules look.. As we having already a branch of vehicles so servicing and maintenance is not an issue.. Now i am planning to buy same bike for myself so that whenever i will go to leave.. I will ride my own #royalenfieldclassic350.
325,5,This bike is awesome in riding and the comfort of riding in slow speed is too good.And second thing is sound that are mind blowing. I love that sound that's why it's called my dug dug dug. I Want to buy second bike as it is same because i can't use another bike as a enfield...Royal enfield family are very happy with this bike.
326,5,I had an extraordinary experience with my bike ... Really feeling very happy to buy it ... It has an amazing look and bitter truth that it has an powerful performance ... I had only one service with it because it doesn't gave me any fault ... I have waited since 2-3 years for it and had this heaven re.
327,4,"Style & looks: 5/5  Mileage: 4/5 (considering its a 350 cc, it easily gives 30-35 kmpl)  Maintenance: 4/5 (not many problems, but don't compare it with a 150 cc daily commuter bike. You got to pay a little price for luxury)  Royal enfield classic is great mix of style and pleasure. Riders who are looking for sheer pleasure in riding should go for re. You got to respect the bike and it ride carefully. Since its heavy machine it comes with little bit of price, in terms of taking care of the bike, regular service etc. But it's all worth it, since no other bike in this segment can get you this kind of ride comfort, classic vintage looks, good mileage, decently priced."
328,5,Amazing ha handling with a confidence while at tough turf. Bike has given wings to the speed performance and best part is bike self start.The tyre’s are better with high level of grip.The single or double sitting completes the bike in all the way with the flexibility part. Average is better than what it was earlier.
329,5,"BUYING EXPERIENCE: Firstly the buying experience was good and got bike delivered within a week on exactly the day they promised to deliver. RIDING EXPERIENCE: Coming to riding experience, very happy about it no other word than 'SUPER' be will make justice for riding experience, at least for me. But I feel its not much comfortable for pillion for even the medium distance rides. LOOKS: No other bike gives you a biker identity as this, people's attention on it has reduced now a days because these bike have become more common in recent years. PERFORMANCE: Good. SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE: This is the part where it get worse maintenance is little bit costly but if you love your bike you should maintain it well with enough care, but the servicing experience is not so good at service centers. Pros: Looks Comfort And many things Cons: Servicing experience"
330,5,Nothing like royal enfield. Every company try to be like that but no one can compete royal enfield. It is amazing bike with super sound therapy.Only those can understand who had ridden it.I like it's vintage look as well as it's beautiful seating posture. I never ever seen such a beautiful posture in any Indian bike in this segment.
331,5,Amazing and unbelievable comfort during each ride. The classic look of the vehicle is the most attractive sector of the bike. The engine performance is immaculate and it's one of the most loved and owned vehicle by most of the youngster in India .People consider it as a pride to own a royal enfield motorcycle. Proud to be an enfielder...
332,5,"1. I have bought my bike 2015 january Starting model it was amazing 2. After riding that bike. I Cant able to drive any other bike, i Have car but i will go long drive on thi re 350. I was amazing and it performance is well Done by re manufacturing 4 the service and maintenance is very high But i have Maintained by it good performance."
333,5,"I bought the royal enfield classic 350 - lagoon blue in october, 2015. It's not a performance bike rather it leaves you with a grin every time you reach your destination and get off for a quick sip of tea and samosa. I never gave up for this bike as this always left me to push this bike further. Its a good cruiser, daily commuter and off road as well. If you are among the one who maintain their bikes all by themselves; you are the perfect owner."
334,5,"Royal enfield is the best bike for me and also lucky because this bike give me a service in a big company so i think it's lucky for me, and also my friend buy a royal enfield thunderbird it's good but my its better than friend. I am looking a macho look with my royal enfield classic 350 best colour with green so i am happy with my great bike."
335,5,Nice bike. Look and style is awesome. Made like a gun and goes like a bullet. Travelling is very fine. No disturbances. Travelling is very fine and careful. It look likes very stylish and sound is very awesome. Black colour is my favourite. It look like a royal look. Nice bike and travelling is very awesome.
336,5,Its a really great and a royal bike for sure. Would really like to buy it so. The suspension and the handling plus the comfort is amazing. Its just amazing! royal enfield has got no comparison with other bikes as it has got another level in the world of bikes.... I would definitely get it if i could someday.
337,4,"You have to wait 30-45 days after booking which is very long time can change your mind. When you get the bike you have to invest on it. Like on leg guards, seat covers, light covers etc. Which are for your safety company do not give it. Classic 350 have best look in its type of bike as it is cruising bike. Service and maintenance are average not so high. Lets see the cons 1. Tyres are not tubeless so puncture cannot be fixed by yourself easily and it is very difficult to push such a heavy machine. 2. Engine is air cooled so it becomes so warm in summer and sound of tappet start coming from engine. 3. Lack of disc break in rear tyre and abs. 4. Lack of petrol gauge. Now pros 1. Engine is so powerful produce constant torque even on mountains 2. Very reliable bike in every condition 3. Off roading can be done easily 4. Best for touring 5. Average is also good. Precautions do not use allow wheels kerb weight is high can damage easily on high speed."
338,4,"Well royal enfield has always been a value for money. I have it for about 3 yrs now and enjoyed every moment while riding an awesome experience. Over the years we have seen several changes but in today's time the details , performance enhanced no doubt. Well service and maintenance is not very costly. I think it is the macho machine in the same price segment"
339,5,This bike is my dream bike. Its a complete and male bike this bike in no 1 brand and bike in this world. This is one of the most wanted bike in youths and college students. This bike used an royal look. This bike is complete and safety one. Modified on this generation. This bike is complete on 4 generations.So this bike is valuable thinks in world. This is a very big gift.
340,4,"1. Buying experience in one of the best .2. Riding experience is good but it doesn't have any fuel level indicator.3. Look wise it stand out in crowd, performance wise it is ok.4. Service is also good5. Pros :- look good , reliable bike , smooth riding experience, lot of customization options.Cons :- no fuel indicator, little over price , seat cushions are not up to the mark."
341,4,"This bike is worth riding. A bike lover would fall in love with the features like it's looks, comfort and feel.  It actually gives a royal feeling. Ideal speed to ride classic e50 or any other royal enfield bullet is 40 - 45 kmph.  It gives a royal feeling at that speed.  Mileage and price are the only issues but the royal feel of the actually makes you forget it and enjoy the royal treatment the bike gives you.  Thus a royal enfield lover would always go for royal enfield."
342,4,I have to wait 1month to buy this bike.. Riding experience is good. A little pain in my boom while I rode it above 100kms continuously. It gives a retro look and I love it. Service cost is slightly higher. But I have not face any major issue. Its mileage is 30 to 35. Performance is good.. It can run 80km/h easily.. pros- looks is awesome engine is good. Good mileage though it is 350cc Cons-Vibration is the big issue.
343,5,It's amazing bike . I love it ...It's gives you the real feeling on tours on mountains ..Icy hills. I ride in uttrakhand hills and mountains and i feel the movement i enjoyed a lot with my royal bike. I suggest everyone to take royal bike for royal tours and you feel royal among your friends circle.
344,5,"It's was good choice in my life towards motorcycle i have passion about riding and finally i owned it, it was 1 and half yr with my machine it's gives same feel same thump i'm happy with royal enfield about look it's just not a bike its a machine great performance and about maintenance yeah good enough and very good at road grip breaking and yeah I can't explain my machine."
345,5,"Riding experience is not imaginable.While riding the bike my feelings are very high,after buying this bike i came to know that royalty will comes to me by this bike only,it looks awesome,i bought black colour it looks very attractive i become a fan to my bike.The performance of my bike is satisfactory and mileage is 35 kmpl. Servicing and maintenance also satisfactory i like this bike so much.Finally royalty comes to me while riding royal enfield"
346,5,1. Cost effective and worth based on performance.  2. You feel very good while riding this and actually you can feel the enjoyment.  3. It has classic look. It gives the feel like it is made for men.  4. Service and maintenance is good.  5. No drawbacks on this. Just you need to take care of this.  just go for it. In future you will definitely feel like the decision was very good.
347,4,"The bike is good,it is reliable, the thump is energetic.The mileage is good.The best part of this bike is it is a legend.But in this price tag other bike offer much more features; but in this bike even fuel gauge is also not offered.And it vibrates after the speed of 100km/h.If more features would have been offered it would have been an awesome deal."
348,5,Awesome bike that i had ever drive in my life the sound of the engine makes feel like a hero of the film so excited to drive the bike every day . Every morning when i wake up i see my bullet first and start other works the sound of my bike makes you astonish that why i call it made like a gun goes like a bullet
349,5,I bought it in 2017 august and since then i have enjoyed riding it every morning; since my office is very nearby and i am not an adventurer kind of a person so bike hasn't been ridden too much even in 2 years. I have maintained it very well and it's in excellent condition.It's been getting service timely and till today not even a single accident.
350,3,I had earlier old bullet before year 2000 make. It is very good quality. But these days new bullet like normal gear system is very bad quality. I never expected this will happen from enfield. Chain/chain wheel all getting damaged soon within 1-4 years.. Body metals are not that good.. Actually this is happening to almost everyone i enquired.. Dear enfield please check the quality of new bikes hereafter..
351,3,"Buying experience :  I bought my dream bike royal enfield classic 350 3 yrs back. I had to wait for 6 months before it was delivered to me .  Riding experience :  I would say the most comfortable bike if you get the perfect riding posture for you  which depends on your height and weight . I achieved this by trying different handlebars (easily available in aftermarket), adjusting shockers ,nitrogen filled tubeless tyres and alloy wheels .  3. Details about looks , performance etc :  I would say i loved the cg of the bike , never felt any lag in power and bike has lot of control. But obviously it took me six month before i could lean my bike on sharp turns. Bike has lots of power even with a payload of 200 kgs .  4. Servicing and maintenance :  I personally do not like the service done by royal enfield authorised guys . They just do the replacement of parts and washing . I tried my servicing with guys who have been doing it for old bullet. Yes, the bearing and chain sprocket was always been a issue and small t"
352,2,"I bought my bike 6 months ago. I felt i am proud owner of classic 350 redditch model. Few days back my bike broken down near my shop. Then i called rsa(road side assistance) which royal enfield claims a 24x7 service. They asked me to put my bike in some safe place as they cannot provide service. I felt bad and that was obvious. Because when u buy a bike for rs 1.80 lakh, you would expect much better service, showroom owner said i don't have mechanics right now so i would send it tomorrow. But today again i face the same problem and the showroom owner gave me the same excuse. It is so heartbreaking. I like travelling places on my bike. Now after such poor service. I am scared. What if my breakdown in the middle of a forest or unknown place. What if i get same reply that time. Please think before buying. besides service bike is awesome. Feel proud. But service will let you down,Major cons.1. Service.2. Poor wiring. (because right now i come to know that there was cut in wire, and the wire was totally covered."
353,3,"Guys if you are looking for buying re then you should think twice as its service is high,it irritates lot after 1 year bike demands more service its suspensions are not good and bike is low so some time brake touches its my personal opinion but riding it gives good feeling that tic tic sound and vibration irritates very much"
354,3,bike is good but parts are very expensive. too much vibration as like tractor no much comfort. top speed is not satisfied 110-120kmph. pillion comfort is nil. worst for pillion. pick up is good service quality is good but somewhere is bad. light is good. rear brakes are not satisfied. royal Enfield should provide led lamp for good battery life because of AHO. rear suspension is not good so RE provide mono shock suspension
355,3,It was good but it takes more fuel and it has good sound and comfortable riding and really attract others by its sound and great bold look it had but it has only did advantage of oil leaking and drinking more fuel and it was one of the good bike which i ride on road it was really awesome but it has to be improved some features.
356,3,"If you are a type of twisting throttles ,racing with other fellow riders ,cornering lover and all don't choose the classic 350 . The bike vibrates a lot above 90km/hr..If you are a guy of pleasant riding experiences ,long cool rides you can choose this one ..The braking is also not perfect climbing a hill and all you will know the power of classic 350 but i will tell you again won't feel good to youngsters who loves cornering and all.. Otherwise for peaceful riding the classic is good"
357,3,"The dealer did a good part in giving timely delivery. For daily commute it is awesome on city roads can be manoeuvred easily, has good cornering ability in spite of its weight and you don't feel tired at all. Fuel efficiency is also fairly good. I get 35 - 40. Coming to speed part, the sweet spot is 65-70kmph. At 80 you will feel slight vibrations which are manageable. At 85 plus The vibrations become significant and it is not safe to ride this bike at above 80 except on straight highways. I have clocked 110kmph when i rode with the wind and the vibrations were so intense that even a minor bump on road would have thrown me off. Braking is another dangerous aspect about this bike . On one occasion i had to brake hard at about 65kmph and 5th gear , first rear and after a fraction of a second, front brake too. The bike skidded and fell to the right. I was lucky to wear a thick jeans that day which saved my leg from burning under the silencer as the leg was stuck under it for more than a second.You have to get h"
358,2,This worst bike ever..What is riding experience means.  Full burnout engine...Oil dripping never be solved...Handle curve worst in segment..You can't do work fast with this bike...In case of emergency it's dumbest bike...And after purchase you have to carry burden of service centre...Cause they are making fool everybody and their aim only to making money...Not satisfied customer..
359,2,"Bs4 is really bad compared to bs4  Self start is not working properly , so many noises while driving, mileage also bad 29 kmpl in city , 34 in outer , kick start is ok , bs3 is better i think , my brother owned bs3 good to drive and maintain is easy  Always remember to check the battery box. All re bikes key is working in any bike battery box , always check that"
360,3,"The pros: Bike is quite sturdy. Loads of torque. Dual disk break works well. Macho feels. You can seat with youur parents unlike other bike such as dominar or ktm. Cons: Doesn't have fuel gauge, new one has i guess.Max speed you can go is 90 post which it vibes a lot. So cruise at 80-90 on highway.Opinion - if you ride fast n have gang of friend who have other bike you can't keep up with them."
361,3,I have been using this for 2 months the new abs model and the riding feel could have been good but due to the vibration i can't drive it for more than 100km in a single ride... Due to high vibration u can't even see anything in mirror... Braking is good... Mileage is bad as i am getting only 25kmpl in city and 27kmpl in highway.... Not happy with the bike...
362,1,Comfort to ride First service charges is 900 rupee. Highway mileage is 36 kml. In local ride mileage is 28 to 32. They have no tubeless tyres. There is a main problem to go long trip. Next coming model to give tubeless tyre take it easy And they comes with carburetor engine Air cooled engine To go long not heating issues they open engine.
363,3,Pros 1. Excellent ride quality 2. Feel the power 3. Easy maintenance 4. Feel like king 5. Great pick up Not any bike below 3 lakhs can match this beast. Cons 1. Lots of vibration 2. Buying is headache 3. Shaking above 100km/hr 4. Self start is pathetic 5. Cheap quality parts But anyway i love my r.E. So much.
364,1,I am having classic 350 bs4 and i purchased this at 4/april/2017  poor performance is giving by that vehicle  this is one of the worst experiences from my side to purchase select a bike of your brand  please first train your employees how to handle the customers and how to resolve the problems of customers.  Poor service giving by your service center in my area  and i am not purchase a single product from your company seriously.
365,1,"Hi, i had booked stealth black 500cc in the state of karnataka karwar but i didn't understand why the bullet is taking too much time to deliver the bike this is horrible i am waiting from 1 month they says stealth black will come with abs so it's taking too much time the royal enfield one of the biggest two wheeler motorcycle company why taking too much time i can't understand."
366,3,my dream bike classic 350 i got it.but riding experience very worst i feel it. really looks is awesome performance 80 klm speed is better.more than noise problem I'm disappointed.service experience very bad. first 400 kilometer reached clutch plate damaged not moved bike.not claimed bike charge.gear shifting problem.automatic 1st geared moved bike. i am really i thought irritating service experience very very bad.
367,3,"I was excited while buying it. After i bought i thought this will be cool bike... The roaring sound was superb... Riding feels good for an average speed rider..Vibration is too much, after the service also the vibration continued, made like gun goes like bullet the tagline doesn't match, as the technology evolved they could have boosted power hp and torque and mileage, it's power is less but the engine displacement is more 350cc..They have maintained same old classic look little changes have been made the look is good, maintenance is cost effective, normal maintenance required as per your driven km..Services are done by experts trained ones..Advantage is vintage feel and roaring sound of engine...Disadvantaged is less efficient, less power"
368,3,"Style the style is perfect for long rides. Just one thing pinches that the colour is too sensitive. Just a scratch of nail too is enough to damage the look.  Engine performance, fuel economy and gearbox engine performance is good, but needs attention towards the oil seals. Clutch and gear box leakages need to be repaired. It shows the lithargy while assembling the bike. Fuel economy is perfect. Gearbox need to be smoothened.  Ride quality & handling perfect.  Final words finishing of the logo, fuel tank cover and the colour is too poor. Rest, the bike is perfect.  Areas of improvement assembly needs to be improved. Plastic cover of the dynamo needs to be replaced with steel.  Pros  engine performance  cons  loose oil-seals and substandard finish/colouring"
369,2,"Bike too much vibration,There is no fuel gauge...Fast engine hitting...Give us a body cover...Too much price of bike...We love the original bullet bike but there is not more vibration and there is too much noise while changing gear...Must have a fuel meter...How can we ride without fuel gauge."
370,1,"I didn't own this.... But i have riding it for long.... My friends bike..... For its price point its useless... Never goes beyond 120 for a 350cc....Not tech no led lights no digital instrument cluster have a hell lot of vibration, heavy metal huge weight, 0 to 100 at the worst top speed worst...... Huge amt for service they create scene as thought like the best brand and best bike of the world.... If you really wanted to own bike.... Never ever go for re.....Has a ton lot of other bike.....Literally don't buy any bike other than 650cc segment in re."
371,1,The classic 350 bike is a waste of money among other royal enfield series...Very bad vibration and poor riding quality. After one year the bike is such a waste of money. If you really need a quality product go for bullet 350 it is far better than classic 350. The service and maintenance is very bad in showrooms and after every service the electrical compliant increasing day by day.
372,1,I had purchased royal enfield electra bike on before six month but now bumper will getting crack for full round.I went to service center (eagle motors kullampalayam) several times they will not respond probably and also nobody see the problematic pumper and bike. I am very upset why chose the royal enfield No link between company name and its services So nobody buying royal enfield its fraud company.
373,2,Before writing this i would say that everyone has there own driving experience.  Its been almost 2 year and would like to highlights some below points:  1. Not comfortable for rider and pillion  2. Too much vibration  3. Loose control after 70km  4. Heavy maintenance.  If anyone still like royal enfield and comfortable ride then electra model which has better handle bar position and seat.  Again this is my opinion. Drive well before buying it
374,3,handle it easily in heavy traffic.. But in looks its killer.. And from my persnal view i'll not suggest any one to purchase it for daily commute.. You may prefer another bike which have less weight n vibrations so u can easily travel in traffic areas. Thank you...
375,3,"Worst buying experience  Riding experience is not so great  No fuel meter is a setback  Worst services  If you park your bike in rain it won't start because of poor built quality overall i'm not satisfied with the bike chain sprocket is also worst better go for some other bike. Not worth for money, waiting period is also high"
376,3,"Service & maintenance was burden. Chassis should upgrade Looks good Performance also good. Not recommended to go on monsoon. If battery drains vehicle not get ignition. Vehicle got vibrated at speed of 60 - 100km/hr. Rear disc system is too worst as compared to low cc vehicles. Always check meter bulbs , fuses all time."
377,3,I bought bike from ahmednagar. Service at showroom was not that much great. They should maintain some standard for service.Bike riding experience was awesome the only thing they should look into is vibration on high speed. If you drive above 90 you will feel very high vibration and that is not a good thing. I am getting 40-45 kmpl mileage. Company should provide trip meter and fuel meter..I did goa trip on this bike and experience was awesome...
378,3,"Got the bike on 2018 december, sold the bike on december 2019. Bike just vibrates once you cross 70 kmph, your hands become numb if you continue riding. Did a road trip from chennai to blore and had to stop atleast 5 times. Takes it's own sweat time to hit 95-100. Pros: good for city, for everyday use to commute to office (45-65 kmph). Not worth the hype, have never understood why people recommend res for long ride/tours.I am happy that i sold this piece of garbage."
379,1,"Dear sir,I am very much sorry to say that i have not got a proper service from your royal enfield service station,chandikhol, jajpur, orissa.Before 15 days,i had done my bike service at your service station at chandikhol and also changed my engine oil. But next day onward i saw a oil leakage. Then i went your service station on 23/5/20 and informed the person who is sitting at reception counter about my leakage problem.But he informed me that to take a photo copy .Then on next day i observed the leakage of engine oil again.Then on 24/5/20,i visited your service station again and informed then about the matter.Then they serviced my bike and informed me all as ok.I also paid them the charge as much as they informed.But on 25/5/20,again i observed a leakage of oil again. Then i washed my bike engine yesterday.But today again i observed the leakage. Today i contacted the service station, For a simple problem should i visit 4 times to your service station? and is it fare to deal with your customer? I am a govt se"
380,1,"I was a user of tvs bikes. I used tvs bikes for long 30 years. Then i went for this piece of shit (enfield bike) due to family compulsion. Ancillary components of the bike is extremely poor. It run only 9000 km during the last one year (kl 06 g 8211) but i had to change gear cable, clutch wires and accelerator cables, head lamp bulbs for three times). Two times i had to change the break shoe. Horrible and miserable experience. I am a soldier, my request you all ; please do not go for a shit enfield bike. Go for any other brand in India."
381,1,I don't have a word to speak about re tappet sound has made me to sell so i sold the bike  the service of re is too bad in some city like ulhasnagar i suggest my friends not to buy re  being a biker i had a bad experience while riding the re classic 350  my suggestion is not to buy this bike until the issue gets resolve but re
382,2,3.5 month waiting was there to buy this.  Riding is okay but you cant ride it roughly if you try there is lots of problems comes to you.  Engine is very poor.  Self wearings approx 5500 rs. And two times changed in 3 years.  Chain sets approx 2100 rs and changed two times in 20000 kilometers.  Soccer's are also cheap.  Alignment of tyre worst. Always touch with mudguard.  Abnormal sounds comes from electric plugs and from engine.  Overall if you have own service center then okay. On every 2000 km. It will take 5000rs money for its service if you ride it tightly.
383,1,Royal enfiled company service is untrusted don't buy this bike . This company has not value of customer. This company is 3rd class company i think 3rd class also better on this company. Totally loss of money of customer. Java is better than royal enfield service also good java bike. Don't buy royal enfield. Its pure waste of money.
384,3,"1.I wait long time to buy it,around 1 month&12 days.  2.Good for medium speeders above 80 km/h it vibrates a lot.  3.Classy look descent one but performance was not good(no worth for 1.5 lakhs) .  4.Servicing cost little higher when compare to other brands in 350 cc.  5. 1-vibration  2-rusting  3-average speed  4-no fuel gauge&disc  5-no premium quality of components,only brand image"
385,3,"I got mad about these bullet family so i choose classic 350. But it’s a lot of complaints my money was loose many many problem . Looks and performance are good. Riding experience good. Service and maintenance are too coast. Classic is useful for citizens . I am a youngster so so my vision about classic is so bad but royal enifiled himalayan , gt interceptor is ok for us."
386,2,"I've been using this bike for about 1.5 years, and within one year I've changed the battery, chain sprocket, break shoes(couple of times), once I had petrol leakage and they changed some part . Maintenance is extremely difficult and costly. I use it for about 50 plus kms daily. And service centers doesn't deal it like a premium bike. I had been completely disappointed after buying this machine. apart from look nothing will satisfy you."
387,3,Redditch red 350 classic !  Bike is perfect ! gives good mileage around 35-40km  Gives smooth driving till 60-85km/h  Handlebar vibrates after 90km/h  Bs4 engine gives less sound than u get for previous one  A slight difference in height !  Service promise time is 45 mins !  Good bike for 1.5l  Can go through rough roads
388,3,"Buying experience was good but i have to wait for around a month.My riding experience was good as i expected but i faced many problems .I love this bike very much and the performance,mileage is good. But it gets dirty very quickly and sometime gears gets struck, bike didn't get start in one push, sometime it doesn't show neutral indicator.Braking is fair enough.Silencer gets to hot and it is dangerous to the pillion rider.The bike is quite heavy but salute for royal enfield for balancing the bike.Service cost is ok but to maintain the bike is little bit expensive.Pros....1. Good mileage 2. Good performance.3. Good royal look 4. Good for touring.5. Can be customised. 6. Most accessories in the market. cons.....1.High maintenance cost.2.Fuel meter is missing.3.Silencer get too hot.4.Price is little bit higher."
389,2,"Not a satisfactory bike, braking system is not good, the silencers are so much noisy, mileage is also not good, every-time there is some problem in engine. The sitting posture on this bike is not so comfortable. If take long drive through this bike feel pain in back. There is no mileage gauge in speedometer."
390,2,"Service is pathetic i have been facing problem with the clutch and gear and every time when ever i give service it is not done correctly and also the spare parts used in royal enfield. Quality of the bike is bad.. Never ever buy the bike its better go with international brand like yamaha, kawasaki and ktm."
391,1,I have classic 350 2017 model. Problem is pick up problem. Some times good pick up and sometimes its like tvs excel. I complained 4 times in head office. Every time they say to give it to service centre. I given so many times. But still now no pick up. Its very bad. I never expected this from royal enfield
392,1,The service( maintenance ) section is very poor and waste because my own new bike is still there ( kozhikode store ) more than 2 months. Many times we have requested for maintenance speed up but no response no reply. The service team of royal enfield delayed solving my problems. So i am disappointed and refused next time i won't buy a royal enfield.
393,2,"My bike model is 2017. For 1 year no problem after that we want face lot issue. And mileage problem also coming after 1 year for 30kmpl. Noisy engine after 1-2 yrs! rusting issue! is it worth buying re ? just for looks and feelings? re should think about people, what they expect in 1.6 lakh rupees, look into this..."
394,1,Year ago we had taken a royal enfield classic 350 from saini motors margao goa ...Since after 2nd service that bike started giving noise of engine valves soon we went to the showroom saini motors they did something n gave... But that problem is not till today.. Very bad service provided by saini motors ..... They say that is the normal noise... But it can be clearly make out that noise is of engine valves... They are just to loot people and nothing else ... No proper service provided.
395,3,I don't prefer the classic 350 anymore.... Was so mad about this bike before i own it... Its not a better choice for a long ride.. Its riding comfort is bit low.. The troubles are with the seating comfort both the front and back.... And the other problem is with the vibration... Its vibrating terribly that we will get irritated...And the maintenance is the next problem...Moreover i suggest as well as i prefer classic 500 or standard 500 now..
396,3,"my bike on road 1.42 lakhs royal enfiled classic 350 black 2015 good= driving max 80 km ,good balance ,off road drive good,good looking,shock absorber, mileage 30-45 , bad = product quality parts ///engine sound heavy /non tubeless tyre///fast rust parts ///petrol tank inside water, rain season water wash /// no fuel gauge,wire kit fuse outside non protect,non trip meter ."
397,1,"Dealers don't have interest to give right information, my riding experience is very bad it's unsafe bike in India engine is heavy but don't have right breaking system to control and royal enfield have to improve engine its 2017 not 1945, looks is good but performance is very very poor, in India every company provides tubeless tyres and alloy wheels, indicator and lots of facility they can provide but they don't, lots of area to improve service centre is very good they give you right idea about your bike"
398,3,"I purchased this bike two time, first i bought electra 350 and now in 2017 classic 350, this bike is not too good and not too bad. It is ok-ok, this bike is not for fast riding, this is for slow ride and riding enjoyment. Its service centre is very poor, and its break shoe is very poor, i never satisfied for services."
399,3,"This motorcycle is very nicely....Motorcycle sounds like and awesome sounds. Dug..Dug..,Service cost very high.. And mileage 30kmpl....Engine tepet sound problem..Look very nice...Riding quality is excellent...This motorcycle wight very high...Sounds great and smooth ride with pillion....Awesome experience."
400,2,"I was very excited before buying royal enfield classic 350 so i booked the bike got it after the 3 months wait. So in very after very first company's service i had a issue with the rare brake which was never solved it's been 30k km i have been riding and almost 12 to 15 times have changed the rare brake liner. 5 times rare baring, 2 times front wheel baring. After 15k km i has to change the chain sprocket. After 23k km i changed swingarm bush and the worst part about the bike it's engines noise which has been increasing day by day. I don't know where should i take this bike to service i have done it every where but still face the issues with the bike. So finally have decided to sell the bike i m a biker i cannot keep my bike unhealthy the royal enfield is just assembling the bike with worst quality product and making fool of customer, the brand have become non trust worthy."
